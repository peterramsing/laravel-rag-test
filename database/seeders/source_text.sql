All right, so I was up late last night.

Late for me as a dad is like 11 p.m., but I''m sitting here at my computer and my dark basement, you know, pulling notes together.

David, what music did I have on?

You have one guess.

Oh, oh, I know exactly what you had on.

You had Trent Rezner, social network soundtrack.

It makes anything you''re doing feel, you know, twice as important and twice as revolutionary, and it just felt very apt for this episode.

Oh, man.

So I have been listening in the last 24 hours to 50 cent in the club because that came out my freshman year of college same year as the Facebook.com and like, man, 50 cent Facebook.com Can''t get any better than that.

Perfect match made in heaven.

Well, I''ll check out our wall-to-wall from the old days and see if they''re already post about that.

All right, let''s do it.

Let''s do it.

Is it you, is it you, who got the truth now?

Is it you, is it you, is it you, sit me down, say it straight, another story on the way, who got the truth.

Welcome to the Fall 2024 season of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them.

I''m Ben Gilbert.

David Rezenthal.

And we are your hosts.

Today, we are studying a company whose products are used by more humans than any other company in history, Meta.

Of course, formerly known as Facebook.

So I figured I would contextualize these numbers a little bit.

Meta has four billion monthly active users.

And daily active users are over three billion.

Yeah, nuts.

There are only eight billion humans on Earth.

So as I started to brainstorm what the closest competitors could be to serving half of the humans, I thought surely I can find it in empires or governments from the past where there is some larger percentage.

Yeah, it makes sense.

Nope.

The Roman Empire at its peak was only 40% of humans tops, you know, the data is a little hard to actually find from that period of time.

But the British Empire, which we have a little bit better handle on, at its peak was only 23% of the global human population.

So no government tech company utility, et cetera, has ever addressed so much of the world.

It''s just wild.

There''s no other way to put it.

In the over 20 years since its founding, MetaTruly has connected humanity through its apps, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and now Threads.

So today, we''re going to study how they did it.

There''s been a lot of ink spilled writing about Facebook over the years, and for its first 10 years, most of that writing focused on the many benefits to society, with breathless exuberance over milestone after milestone.

And for the past 10 years, it''s kind of seemed like medic could do nothing right.

Reporting focused on its many stumbles, the massive mistakes, the incredible controversies surrounding the company, and well, we will of course discuss these events as part of our story and analysis.

Our goal today on this podcast episode is really to understand how it is that meta became the dominant fabric that connects the human race and why they''ve been so successful at continuing to win over and over again.

No matter what you think of the company, it is undeniably one of the most important institutions in the world, and their global scale is no accident.

It is the result of careful actions from some of the most motivated and brilliant people in the world who believe in one mission, connecting as many people as possible.

And thought about this till now, but almost sort of total logically, this is like the most important episode we''ll ever do to try and understand.

It''s like it''s the biggest company that has ever existed.

It''s the biggest thing that''s ever existed.

Yeah, by these measures that we''re talking about right now.

Right.

Now, of course, the story of how we got here is nuts.

It is the perfect acquired stew like you''re saying David.

They speed ran their startup phase.

They swerved through multiple disruptive technology waves.

They battled fierce competitors.

They invented or maybe discovered one of the greatest business models ever.

And they''re now trying to pull forward the next technology generation through sheer force of will with AR VR and AI.

So finally listeners, we tackle one of the greatest corporate stories ever, Facebook, the Mark Zuckerberg production.

So listeners, we have one big announcement for you today.

It is time for our annual acquired survey.

If you have three to five minutes, please click the link in the show notes or go to acquired.fm slash survey to take it.

We''ll be raffling off a pair of shiny new meta ray bands and giving it a bunch of ACQ dad hats as well.

This is really our one big ask of you all year and it helps us immensely with making the show better to hear your suggestions and also to help our sponsors understand just how impactful the acquired audience is.

So go to acquired.fm slash survey and David and I are both eternally grateful.

After this episode discuss it in the Slack and check out ACQ2, our second show where we just had Clem DeLong, the CEO of Hugging face on, to talk about his view on how the open source AI ecosystem will play out.

And before we dive in, we want to briefly thank our presenting partner, JP Morgan Payments.

Yes.

Just like how we say, every company has a story.

Every company''s story is powered by payments, and JP Morgan Payments is part of so many companies'' journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.

So with that, this show is not investment advice.

David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only.

David, Roman Empire, what''s our starting place here?

No, man.

We got to start in 1984.

We''re never I mean, where else can you start?

I can make up, you know, of Roman Empire, classics, ascolas, whatever T-shirt saying Mark has this day of the week.

But Facebook has always started and ended with Mark Zuckerberg.

So we start in May of 1984 when Mark Elliott Zuckerberg is born as the second of four children to Karen and Ed Zuckerberg in Dobbs, Ferry, New York.

small little suburban town, suburb of New York City.

Yep.

And his mom is a psychologist and his dad is a dentist.

Is that right?

That''s right.

Ed studied dentistry at NYU.

He was always like really into math and computers though, but growing up the son of Jewish immigrants in New York City, you know, the expectation was you''re going to be a doctor or a lawyer.

So he goes to dentistry school, becomes a dentist, he meets Karen, they get married.

After Ed finishes dental school, they move up to Dobbsferry and Westchester County.

And Mark and his three sisters grow up as prototypical middle class suburban American kids in the 90s.

Life is good.

Your grandparents worked really hard to make a bunch of sacrifices for your parents.

Your parents are now professionals.

They''re also working hard to give opportunity to you and the family is kind of leveling up in America.

It''s the classic story here.

You can play sports and you can hang out with your friends and play video games.

Indeed, and for Mark and for me growing up, and maybe you too, it''s kind of amazing.

There''s no reason not to just explore your passions, and for Mark, those passions become threefold.

One, turn-based strategy video games, most particularly Sid Meier''s civilization.

Two, programming computers, and three, as you mentioned in everybody who watched our Chase Center show knows ancient Greek and Latin history, classics, the classics.

And pretty much in that order of importance, both to him personally and the future course of Facebook and Metta.

So let''s start with civilization, September, 1991.

David, I toyed with the intro to this show being, and we are your hosts.

Civilization is a video game upon which, but I decided not to write.

I mean, it''s kind of laughable, but like, no, this is really important here.

So September 1991, when Mark is seven years old, civilization or Siv, as its fans call it, comes out for PCs, and young Mark gets hooked, and for those of you who haven''t played Siv, it is a very particular type of turn-based strategy game, and is probably the foremost example of what is known as the four X genre.

That''s the number four letter X.

And four X stands for explore, expand, exploit, exterminate.

And despite that sort of nefarious sounding nature to the last one there, especially, seven four X games were kind of this radical branch of video games at the time where the action of playing and the way to win wasn''t just about killing all the enemies on screen.

It''s a lot more like a board game or like risk if you''re familiar with that.

It''s about strategy.

It''s about growing and marshalling your resources effectively.

And most importantly, there are multiple ways to win the game.

Most other games out there, you can win by defeating all the other players.

But you can also win by completing a technology development tree and reaching like the peak of technology, which is in the game, launching a spaceship to go colonize a new planet.

So that''s another way to win.

And in modern versions of the game, you can also win by diplomacy by getting elected the leader of the UN.

You can also win by dominating all the other players on either culture or religious dimensions too.

So it''s kind of like this amazing simulation of what it''s like to run one of the top 10 mega capitalization companies in the world today.

But to your point, this idea that it''s turn-based, you tried to amass resources, figure out how to deploy your resources, have multiple concurrent strategies so that you, as the role of the dice of the universe happens and things unfold before you and your- And other players make their moves?

Yep.

Right.

To be able to effectively react to it all and use your resources to win in whatever way winning means to you.

It''s kind of funny.

This is way too simplistic of an analogy and, you know, not fair to mark on any dimension, but the whole construct here sort of reminds me of the book Enders game, you know, like it''s these kids growing up playing this game and they didn''t realize all along.

It was actually the real game.

So playing save and other video games when he''s young PC games leads young Mark to want to learn how to program himself.

So when he''s 10, he has his parents take him to the local Barnes and Noble one day and begs them to buy him C++ for dummies.

And he dives into the book, learns everything in there and because like I need more, I need more.

So after that, his parents hire a local tutor to come and tutor him for an hour a week in programming and learning how to write software.

And Mark has this quote that he says later, I''d go to school and I''d go to class and come home.

And the way I''d think about it was awesome.

I have five whole hours to just sit and play on my computer and write software.

And then Friday afternoon would come along and it would be like, okay, wow, now I have two whole days to sit in write software.

This is amazing.

It really is astonishing as a 10 year old to be learning C++.

This is not basic.

This is language where you are thinking very close to the metal.

You have to be very aware of the constraints of your system, of manually managing memory.

It''s impressive for 14 or 16 year olds to be learning simplistic languages.

This is a whole different ballgame.

As it always is with Mark.

So while he''s a kid here, you know, in Dabbs Fairy, he codes up all sorts of little projects, including a family chat tool for all the networked computers in the house, and also his dad''s dentistry office is attached to the house.

So he builds this network called Zucknet, which is family chat between all the computers, very prescient here.

And then, speaking of family and friend''s chat.

In 1997, when Mark is 13 years old, AOL launches AM.

AOL instant messenger.

Oh, I remember it well.

Many, many, many hours lost to him.

And warning my friends and other dynamics of the AME system to gang up on people and to have other people gang up on me and Oh, man, punting people off aim.

Yes, having to create a new screen name and log off and log on and message someone and pretend you''re someone else.

I mean, the whole, this was middle school.

This was middle school for all of us, and this was middle school for Mark too.

The crazy thing about aim, to go on just a quick little digression here.

I had no idea until doing the research.

It was actually like a rogue skunkworks project within AOL.

Did you know this?

No. No, yeah, so it was a couple of engineers that just went off and built this almost against the wishes of management.

It was not originally intended to really be for social use or for kids at all.

It was more like the idea they had was it was going to be kind of like slack, like chat for workplaces.

Oh wow.

They ended up using it internally at AOL to communicate and that''s actually where away messages come from.

So they came up with a way messages because people would be in meetings or you know This is the days of desktops.

There''s no cell phones barely even laptops people got to lunch And they''d have to put up a message so that when their colleagues were trying to communicate with them They''re like no, no, I''m in a meeting.

No, I''m away That''s the origin of away messages That''s fascinating and it is interesting how you ended up kind of using away messages after a while even Well, you were there just to indicate status is the ultimate emo teenager thing It was like, I am expressing my whole self through this one line away message.

A hundred percent.

So, I mean, for people all of our age, marks age at the time, I mean, that completely changed our social experience when that came out.

So the other important thing about aim when it came out that I had no real conception of at all as a kid was that it was free.

So my family was an AOL family.

Like we were AOL subscribers, we had the UGOT mail, et cetera.

But you didn''t have to be a paying AOL subscriber to download and use AIM and join the network.

AIM goes on to become this total viral thing in North America.

I mean, kind of concurrent with Napster, a little bit before Napster.

It''s the first piece of consumer viral software.

And so by 2001, a couple years after launch, it has 36 million users, including, as we''ve been talking about, basically every middle and high schooler with access to a computer.

And, you know, 36 million users doesn''t sound like a lot today, but you got to remember, the internet was way smaller back then, way, way, way smaller.

Not just in terms of number of people had access, but also number of people who were to litter it in how to use it.

Totally.

It''s the early broadband era.

Is that era we''re talking about?

And you''re right.

Tens of millions of people, at least in the US, had internet access at this point in time.

Yup, and basically all of them, and certainly all the young people were on aim.

So the other important thing about aim and AOL here is it was pretty easy to hack, but like, oh man, there was just a field day that kids and teenagers had with like aim bots, punting software, wares, hacking programs.

If you were someone like me, you were just downloading this stuff off of FTP servers on the internet and installing it on your machine.

And it let you kind of be a punk and like kick people off of A and Bambarting them with messages, you could do some like teenage punk stuff.

But it also let you extend the functionality of what AOL and AIM was.

You could add graphics, you could add emojis, you could draw pictures.

Add lakes in your profile.

Yeah.

Oh, the ASCII aren''t your profile in your away message.

Totally.

And like, this becomes such an important part of teenage culture on the internet as we''re going up.

It''s like all this personalization of like, hey, I don''t want just what AOL gives me.

I want to control this.

Yes.

So for me, I was downloading and using this stuff.

You might have been writing it, although you might have been a little young.

No, I didn''t learn PHP until I was 15 or 16, so call it 2005.

Okay, so yeah, a little later.

Yep.

Mark is one of the kids that''s writing this stuff.

And I think that''s where he got his start.

He was doing Zucknet.

He was doing all these little projects.

But here''s AOL, this sort of unintentionally, infinitely hackable and extensible canvas that he can play around on.

So that''s number two for Mark, you know, passion number two, computers and programming.

And then passion number three is classics.

So Mark, when he enters high school, he''d gone to public school all through elementary and middle school in the Baron Dabbs fairy in Westchester County.

He does two years at the local public high school at Ardsley High School.

And after two years at arts league, Mark is like, well, you know, a couple things.

I''m not sure that this is the right high school for me for the rest of my high school career.

One, I think I would enjoy just being in a sort of like better school, like a higher level of competition, higher level of learning.

You know, he''s definitely at the top of the class at arts league.

Two is, you know, I''m really into Latin and classics and like I''m going to tap out on that real fast here at Artslee.

There''s got to be a place I can go where I can really study this.

And that takes us to Phillips Exeter Academy.

In New Hampshire, right?

Yes.

In New Hampshire.

And so Exeter is one of these private boarding high schools that have existed basically as long as Ivy League colleges have.

And they''re there just kind of as feeder schools into Ivy League colleges.

So Mark applies to Exeter, gets in, and the summer before he''s about to go, the school hosts an event in New York City and the city for incoming two years to meet each other, gets to know the school, get ready, etc.

And there Mark meets another kid who''s a lot like himself who also is really into computers, really into aim and everything going on there.

And Mark''s like, yeah, man, I really made the right choice.

Like everybody here is gonna be just like the two of us.

And that person is Adam Dantleau, future CTO of Facebook.

Amazing they met in high school.

Now the great irony of this story is that Mark and Adam ended up being like the only two kids who are really into computers in the class.

It was just the two of them.

They just happened to meet in New York City at the pre-school event.

Which is probably one of the last few years that that would be the case.

I''m sure if you went to this school today, it''d be 80% of the classes or 100% of the classes really into computers.

Yes, I think in large part because of Mark and Adam, it''s quite different these days.

Yep.

So the two of them, when they get to Exeter, become fast friends, they work on all sorts of computer projects together, software projects.

And by the end of their senior year, to graduate from Exeter, you have to do a senior project.

And, you know, most people do this like a mini college thesis, or they do something in the community, et cetera, et cetera.

Mark and Adam are like, now we''re going to build some software.

This is what we do.

So Mark one day is listening to music on his computer.

I think probably on Win Amp, which is however, everybody listen to MP3s that you got from Napster back in the day.

I think I listened on Sound Jam, but it''s just because I had a Mac.

Oh, yeah.

Future seeds of iTunes.

Yep.

That''s right.

It got acquired by Apple, and then eventually they, I think, built off the same code base and turned it into iTunes.

But everyone used WinAm. That was the aim of music players.

And in fact, AOL, I think, would acquire WinAm, a couple of years later.

Ah. Bring it all into the fold.

So, legend has it.

Mark is listening to a playlist in WinAm one day during his senior year, and he gets to the end of the playlist, and he''s like, why did the music stop?

I listened to so much music all the time on Wind Amp.

It should just know what I like and automatically pick the next song.

It should just be a DJ and then inspiration hits.

He calls up Adam and he''s like, I''ve got our senior project.

We are going to build an AI DJ plug-in for Wind Amp and they call this Synapse and like, they did it, these two high school kids.

They build an AI, I wasn''t called AI at the time, but like a, you know, a recommender system that looks at the data of what songs you''ve consumed on Winamp and predicts what song you''re going to like to consume next.

I mean, it''s basically Spotify today.

What year is this?

This would have been Spring of 2002.

Yeah, really days.

So they build this thing and then they release it to the internet and people start using it.

It It starts getting some adoption and a couple of companies, including Winamp, itself reach out to Mark and Adam and they''re like, hey, do you want to come work here?

Can we buy this?

Yeah.

And I think Microsoft was one of them too.

It was for like a million dollar acquisition offer or something like that wasn''t, you know, crazy.

But these are high school kids.

Right.

In 2002.

Yes.

But yeah, this is really important because they''re about to graduate.

Adam is going to go off to college at Caltech.

Mark is going to go off to college at Harvard in the fall, but Mark is not just like any student coming into Harvard.

He''s like, I can build these things and they have value and big companies are going to be willing to pay me for them.

I don''t need to be that worried about getting a job.

Right, he sort of always knew he had a great fall back plan so it kind of led him be risk on.

So Mark graduates, he goes off to Harvard.

It''s the natural choice on many fronts.

So I mean, one mark, of course, aces is SATs. I think he gets a 1600 on the SATs. There''s this great legend about, you had to take SAT2s to get into college back then.

I don''t know if you still do, but I think you had to have a minimum of three.

Mark doesn''t study or prepare for them at all.

He walks in the day of the test says, I''m gonna take all three that I''m gonna take on the same day.

He gets 800s on all of them.

College admissions was not gonna be a big deal.

and his older sister, Randy, was already there at Harvard.

So clearly, good to go to Harvard if he wants.

Yes.

And I think he wants enough.

Like, I don''t know that it''s that important to him, but he''s like, yeah, sure.

Harvard, it''s the best time to go there.

Yep.

In fact, there''s a video of that.

That''s right.

Have you seen this?

His dad sort of filming his reaction, and he''s pretty measured about it.

It''s very, yep, got into Harvard, and then kind of goes back to doing something else on his computer.

Yep.

And I think for most kids, for most people in the world, you would look at that and be like, what arrogance?

And like, it''s not like 18-year-old Mark is not arrogant, but I think it''s also, this is why all this stuff we''ve been talking about is important.

It''s just not that important to him.

You know, he likes building stuff, he likes making stuff, he knows it has value, he knows people will use it.

Whether he goes to Harvard, doesn''t go to Harvard, goes to college, doesn''t go to college.

It''s just not that big a deal to him, I don''t think.

Yeah, reading in between the lines, it seems like the thing that he was most excited about is, oh, good, a challenging environment where I will encounter other really smart people like myself who are ambitious.

Yes, I think that is totally right.

So Mark gets to Harvard in fall of 2002 and like he said, he goes to class, he does well, but he wants to meet other people and be around other smart folks.

He ends up joining the AEPI fraternity there, like my co-host here, my esteemed colleague been.

Indeed.

Also, my father, while he was in college.

I didn''t know that.

Yeah, that''s right.

That''s right.

Hey, you pipe.

Adam, meanwhile, of course, goes off to Caltech, you know, 3,000 miles away in the opposite corner of the country.

Also, can I just say how crazy is it that Adam DeAngelo would become Facebook''s first CTO?

They don''t go to college together.

Right.

Well, I was going to get into this in a second.

Adam has a very different experience to Caltech.

He ends up graduating from Caltech.

I think they probably do not have the same generous leave policy there that Harvard does because Harvard is weird, right?

It''s like you can leave and if you ever want to come back, you just it''s like you never left.

Oh, we''re going to come back to that in one sec.

Put a bit in that.

But for Adam at Caltech, he still finds time while he''s there to keep working on these projects.

So during his freshman year, he builds something called Buddy Zoo, you know, kind of building on synapse and the success that they had in their senior project.

Buddy Zoo takes your buddy list from AM, from AOL, and effectively turns it into a social network.

So you upload your entire buddy list to Buddy Zoo, and then you get your friends to do so too.

Buddy Zoo then analyzes and gives you a list of who are the friends of your friends, how many degrees of separation do you have to them?

And it automatically identifies clicks of like, oh, who of your friends are part of these clicks and who are their friends.

It measures popularity among users.

This is starting to sound pretty familiar here.

And this is pretty advanced stuff for 2002, 2003.

Very advanced stuff, especially for a side project for a very busy Cal Tech student.

Yep.

So, buddy, Zoo, pretty quickly in the months after Adam launches it, gets a couple hundred thousand users.

There''s gravity to this thing.

It''s becoming fairly big, especially given how small the internet was at the time.

Yeah.

And Adam is like, whoa, okay, this is interesting.

So this is kind of what scale looks like.

Synapse was cool and we had a bunch of people downloading it, but this feels like something more on the order of aim itself.

Like this is really interesting.

And the important thing with Synapse was, it was a single user application.

So it could analyze my songs and tell me what to listen to.

This is the first time Adam Mark, particularly Adam in this case, is discovering a very different type of application that gets better as more people join it.

Yes.

Now we say Adam and Adam definitely built and launched it, but it''s not like Mark wasn''t involved.

They''re staying in touch the whole time and collaborating and working through coding challenges together on what else on aim.

It''s kind of serving its original use case like they''re collaborating through it across the country.

So that summer, 2003, after their freshman year, Adam comes to Boston and gets an internship at the MIT Media Lab.

He discovers this thing called Friendster, another social network out there.

And Adam is like, whoa, this is a dedicated standalone own kind of version of what I just built with Buddy Sue.

This is like really interesting.

And it''s all on the web.

Now, Friendster was based out here in Silicon Valley, had raised money from Kleiner Perkins and Benchmark, right?

Oh, Benchmark too.

I didn''t know that.

Yep.

Which is what tied their hands and why they could not pursue an investment in Facebook.

That''s funny.

Not that I think that was a real possibility anyway, because things were kind of moving so fast, but you never hear them in any of the discussion about who was pursuing Facebook and who was iced out.

They just, they had a competitive investment.

That''s right.

That''s funny.

I never even think about that, because obviously Matt Kohler would go on to become a person-of-board partner at benchmark.

And of course, Matt was an early executive at Facebook.

Yes, exactly.

Interesting.

So here''s Friendster, this example of a real standalone company, social network, growing virally, funded by venture capitalists, based in the San Francisco Bay area, Adams was like, oh, maybe that''s sort of what we should be focusing on.

And by the end of the summer in 2003, Forenster had over 3 million users.

So really interesting, growing really quickly.

Friendster had real scale and grew really fast.

That is something that has kind of been lost to history.

Friendster is like the butt of a lot of jokes, but it exploded out of the gates.

True.

So Adam''s playing around with Friendster.

And Friendster had this feature called testimonials, which was kind of like a Facebook wall.

But in the long run, one of the core problems with Friendster was it positioned itself as a social network and about friends.

But really, it was kind of intended to be a dating site underneath at all.

Absolutely.

That was wink, wink, not a dating site.

It was this idea that like, well, there''s all these other things that are dedicated to dating, so there''s this weird stink about it.

But if you just naturally meet a friend of a friend online through a thing that''s totally not a dating site, then great.

There''s no stigma around it.

Yep.

So, specifically, when it comes to testimonials, the purpose of testimonials was supposed to be like, why you should date somebody or why they would be a great partner, which is funny.

So Adam while he''s playing around with this and he''s telling Mark about it, he actually posts on Mark''s friendster profile a testimonial and he says that, quote, Mark gets way too lucky and he posted this in the summer of 2003 and Adam was telling me the story and he Because on the one hand, it was like a stupid throwaway, you know, double entendre that I put on there because it was a, you know, a dating site.

On the other hand, it is both absolutely true about Mark that he always gets way too lucky and Facebook and meta always gets way too lucky, but it''s not luck, yeah.

It''s actually, Mark, there''s something very different about the way he operates.

It''s, and all the reasons that meta and Facebook get lucky over the years, Mark was always that way.

And it''s always because of Mark.

Mark is unbelievably good at positioning himself for a luck to do its thing.

And specifically at this point in time, what I''m talked about is like, he was always looking around.

He was looking at Friendster.

He was looking at what we did with Synapse.

He was looking at what I did with Buddy Zoo.

He was looking about the projects at Harvard he did that we''re about to talk about.

And he was always thinking, like, how do I incorporate all of this and make whatever I''m doing better?

This was the stew that Facebook is about to come out of.

So this brings us to fall semester 2003-2004, Mark sophomore year, and the famous Kirkland House suite H-33 with Mark Zuckerberg, Chris Hughes, Dustin Moskowitz, and Billy Olson as the four roommates there.

Three of the four of those names are names you may know as the founders of Facebook.

Yes.

So Mark is focused heading into his sophomore year at Harvard.

And he''s not focused on classes.

He''s focused on projects.

And he''s done like 10.

I mean, this is something that, again, is kind of lost to history.

People talk about, oh, there''s the one face-mash thing that he did that led to Facebook.

He did like 10 side projects.

I mean, I remember being in this era of my life where you feel like you have superpowers as a programmer, and you''re looking around, and you''re like, oh, I can make a website for that.

I can make a website for that.

I had the same thing where the world wasn''t saturated with apps yet.

And so you could just like make things that made your life better, or other people''s lives better, or a cool way to connect people.

And I distinctly remember feeling like, how come nobody else realizes you can just do this?

I know what that sort of feels like, and I know that mentality he was in.

There were 10 things that he had worked on, even before face smash.

Yep.

So the first of which, right as they''re getting back to campus that fall, is Mark builds a tool called course match.

Oh, yeah.

That''s right.

And this is as students are shopping for classes for fall semester.

You can upload which classes you''re thinking of taking or which classes you''ve signed up for.

And you can see who of your friends have also signed up for that class or planning to sign up for that class.

This is just text.

All this is, is a list of classes and a list of people who sign up, and it takes Harvard by storm.

I mean, think about it, right?

Like it''s obvious in hindsight, a bunch of college undergraduates, yeah, you want to take classes you''re interested, but like, really you want to make sure you take the classes with the people that you want to be around.

I was literally texting my friend yesterday who was at Harvard at this time, and she said, oh yeah, people totally chose their classes based on who was in them.

Of course.

Of course.

So Mark sees this and he''s kind of like, you know, again, it''s one of these learnings, an observation about the world.

He''s like, wow, people are spending a lot of time on this tool.

It''s literally just lists of people.

You click on a class name and people would spend a lot of time just combing over that list of people.

Totally.

There''s nothing visually compelling here.

So he''s like, well, okay, now it''s time for my next project.

You know, people have registered for classes.

What if there was something visually compelling for people to spend time on.

What if I overstepped a little bit and, uh, yeah.

And this is face mash well chronicled in all the many books stories.

The Stephen Levy book, the David Kirkpatrick book, movies, you know, whatever movies movie movie.

Mark codes this up in one evening in his dorm in Kirkland House, and it''s basically the website hot or not for Harvard with a couple of like actually interesting mechanical twists on it.

Now, the two big problems with it are, one, this is probably just not a good idea or not like kind.

Generally, it is a head-to-head voting mechanic on which picture is, quote, unquote, hotter than the other picture.

The other thing that is really not great is rather than having users upload their own pictures, mark hacks into the Kirkland House, servers and downloads the Facebook photos of all the students to populate the website.

Lowercaseface, space, lowercasebook.

Yes.

So we should probably spend a minute and talk about what a Facebook was before Facebook.

So my big question for you is, did Ohio State have a Facebook?

It did not.

It probably would have been like a telephone book sized thing if they did.

I mean, I went to college in the fall of 2007 and so you could look up people''s email addresses.

If you had their first and last name, you might be able to get some other, maybe major, but it was a text blob.

It wasn''t a photo.

Well, I think most, if not all Ivy League schools back in the day had these Princeton where I went, certainly had these when I showed up on campus.

In fact, Phillips Exeter had one, the private high schools did too.

That''s right.

that''s right.

So you had to give the university or in Exeter''s case, the high school, a school photo of you when you were coming in before you matriculated.

And then they would literally make a book, like a printed book with the names and class years and photos of all the incoming students from the freshman class.

And I think if I remember right at Princeton at least, they would republish the book every year for your class because some people would leave, some people would join, et cetera, et cetera.

All right, so these are photos stored digitally that Mark then, while plugged into the campus network from his dorm room, is accessing downloading and then putting up on his own website that he is hosting.

Yes, called FaceMash.

Now, a couple of interesting things about FaceMash.

One, gosh, if Mark was blown away by the engagement of the Harvard population with CourseMatch, face-mash takes that to such a whole nother level that it actually melts down the servers in Kirkland House.

And the IT department at Harvard has to shut off internet within hours of it going live to all of Kirkland House, less this like continue to spread virally within Harvard and take down like all of the servers.

Oh, so maybe he didn''t actually re-host the images.

Maybe he was just pointing at the URLs that were hosted by Kirkland House.

Oh, I didn''t think about that.

Yeah, that might have been how it worked.

But either way, dude knows how to make something that gets engagement.

Yes, yes, he does.

So the other interesting thing from Mark''s perspective about FaceMash is that it was the first time he was building a rich web app as one of these projects.

He had fully built on the Lampstack, and he had probably used the Lampstack Linux Apache MySQL PHP for course match.

And so to be clear, that''s an operating system, a web server, with Apache MySQL, the free open source database, PHP, the free open source programming language.

Yes.

But this is the first time that he''s building like a real rich consumer grade web app on top of the lamp stack.

Rich consumer grade.

It''s the technical requirements of course match, but with photos.

Photos in voting.

Sure.

Yeah, you have like probably an additional table of information in the database or something, but the big takeaway here is, A, of course, the use case shouldn''t have done it.

B, wow, it''s engagement.

C, this is training wheels of how to use these new open source web technologies.

If you go back two, three, four years, you''re going to have to go to Oracle, you''re going to have to go to Microsoft, you''re going to have to buy enterprise grade, super proprietary systems to do this.

And this is all just like free and something you could cobble together and upload onto some Linux web hosting and boom, there had to be a hundred times more, a thousand times more web applications created by the Mark Zuckerbergs everywhere in this period of time doing whatever random little project that they thought would be fun or funny or useful.

Yeah, it''s such a perfect example, despite its problematic nature of this is like the first time in history where you need neither money nor permission to launch an application like this on the internet.

Totally.

$10 domain, $100 a year web hosting that includes the database, no licenses required, PHP is all free.

Maybe the bandwidth would have been an issue, but this is on the order of $100 to do this.

Yeah.

Well, clearly the bandwidth wasn''t an issue because they shut down the internet to Kirkland House.

So David, this feels like a thing you should get kicked out of school for doing.

Yeah.

Harvard, as you imagine, is not pleased about this.

They hallmark in front of the administrative board, which is a disciplinary committee for students when things like this happen.

He and his fraternity brothers are pretty sure that he''s actually going to get thrown out of school for this.

So the night before the ad board meets to make their final decision, AEPI, the fraternity throws a good-by-mark party that night.

And legend has it that this is where Mark and Priscilla Chan meet for the first time in Priscilla, of course, is now Mark''s wife.

Yep.

So the abort meets the next day and decides not to throw Mark out of school but to put him on disciplinary probation for the rest of the year.

Basically, don''t do this again.

Slap on the wrist.

Slap on the wrist.

So Mark doesn''t end up getting kicked out of Harvard.

But he does kind of end up becoming like the Harvard computer celebrity, even before Facebook.

Right.

I mean, this is a big deal.

Everyone on campus knew about face mash.

A lot of people already knew about course match anyway.

So he''s now the guy who can make websites and web applications here at Harvard that people use.

Yeah, and it just so happens that there is a group of upperclassmen at Harvard led by two twins, the Winklevoss twins, who have an idea to digitize Harvard''s Facebook and build an online version of it that they''re thinking of calling the Harvard connection, then they think maybe we could actually take that to other schools too and call it connect you as sort of the broader version.

This was not at all a unique idea, not at all.

Lots of people at lots of schools had this exact same idea.

In fact, Harvard word itself had this idea.

The IT department at Harvard had been promising for years and talking about how they were going to build a digital version of the Harvard Facebook.

And friendsters out there.

And I looked it up.

Stanford had club nexus, Columbia had C U community, Yale had Yale station.

I''m sorry, there''s a whole movie made about the drama of how novel this idea is.

It''s not totally not.

I''m pretty sure Princeton had one too when When I was there, pre-facebook, yeah, totally not a novel idea, lots of people have it.

The Winklevast twins though, you know, Mark is now this celebrity on campus, they need somebody to be a programmer to write the site.

So they talk to Mark and Mark agrees that he''s going to help them out and help code this site that they''re thinking about.

Also, again, the Chutzpah to say, we have this idea, you are a programmer, you will program our idea.

Clearly, Mark can come up with his own ideas that get people excited enough to use the stuff he builds.

Now, so far, it''s been a little unsavory, but he doesn''t have a problem coming up with ideas with product market fit and executing them end to end.

The only thing he hasn''t done so far is made money, made anything as a business.

But what other pieces of the puzzle does he really need from some people with an idea?

None.

It''s funny.

I was going to save this for a little later, but let''s talk about it now.

Now, in addition to technically because of open source and the lamp stack, and also socially because of AIM and everything going on, the world sort of for the first time something like Facebook being able to be built for no money and no permission.

Also this was the first time that a technical person, because of this, could just do everything.

Like Mark didn''t need anybody.

Mark didn''t need a non-technical co-founder.

Mark didn''t need a CEO.

He was the CEO.

I remember thinking the same thing when I shipped my first app to the App Store, co-founder Ian and I in 2009, I think made something called Seas the Day, got over a million downloads, two programmers uploaded some of the App Store at a slightly different era because that''s mobile not web, but I remember looking around being like, whoa, we like didn''t need a business guy.

Right.

That''s the craziest thing.

You can make stuff and you can put it in the world.

totally.

So this takes us to Harvard''s Christmas break.

Now at the time, Harvard did final exams for the fall semester after Christmas break in January.

So the idea is all the students go home for Christmas break.

You come back in January and then there''s a week of reading period where you re-familiarize yourself with all the material from your classes, then you take final exams, then there''s a little break.

There''s a course shopping period for spring semester and spring weeks to program a new idea.

Exactly.

To not study in program a new idea.

And during Christmas break, he had actually come out to Silicon Valley, to the Bay Area, to hang out with some friends out here, and seeing, you know, the physical embodiment of all these great tech companies, Yahoo, early Google, et cetera, drove by them all.

And so he comes back and he''s like extra, extra motivated.

He''s like, you know, this digital Facebook idea, I think this is something that a lot of people want.

I bet I can code this up in a week and just launch it.

And again, not a business, just like a project.

He has this gut feeling that people will use this if he makes it.

Totally.

Now importantly though, all the stuff he''d been doing throughout the year, he''s like, well, I can incorporate that into this project too.

It''d be pretty boring if it''s just a digital Facebook.

Like, I don''t think people want that, but I''ve made all this other stuff that people really, really like and engage with.

And when you say just a digital Facebook, you mean like essentially the profile page would just be a photo in a name.

Right, just like the physical version of like, here is a list of all the students in the class and here is their, you know, stock profile picture.

Yep.

So later, after thefacebook.com blew up, Mark told the Harvard Crimson in an interview, you.

I don''t really know what the next big thing is because I don''t spend my time making big things.

I spend time making small things and then when the time comes I put them together.

That''s the kind of stuff I do.

Small little projects and eventually they all fit together.

And that''s what the Facebook.com ends up being.

So Mark gets back from reading period.

Instead of studying he dives in.

He I am his friend Andrew McCullum who he knows from CS classes and asks Andrew to do the page design.

Andrew says, yeah, sure thing, I''ll help you out.

Andrew goes and fires up Photoshop.

He finds an image on the internet of some guy who looks kind of cool and puts it in the header of the design for the site.

Behind a cloud of ones and zeros because it''s cool.

It''s like the matrix.

Yes.

It''s gradiented.

You know, it''s sort of white on the left, blue on the right.

And for like, you know, a year or two, However, along the Facebook guy was it the header, everybody''s like, who is the Facebook guy?

People think it''s Al Pacino, people think it''s a student.

Do you know who the Facebook guy was?

I totally do.

I look this up.

I smell like two hours trying to figure this out, really?

Yeah, it''s amazing.

Because everyone always said it''s Al Pacino and I''m like, it doesn''t really, no.

Al Pacino must have looked really different when he was younger.

And it''s not.

All right.

Tell me your answer.

I''ll tell you if it matches mine.

All right.

So there was an 80s song that got really big called centerfold.

Oh, yes.

This is it.

And the images of Peter Wolf.

Yep.

Who is the lead singer of the J.

Giles band?

We''ll link to that image.

There''s a great Kora post, which we should say, Adam D''Angelo, founder and CEO of Kora after Facebook.

There''s a great Kora post about this where there''s unmistakably the photo of Peter Wolf that Facebook guy is based on.

They just sort of pixelated it and made it duotone instead of the original photograph.

So great.

So great.

So on the evening of February 4th, 2004, after final exams, right when students are coming back, getting into the mode for the new semester, starting to shop for spring semester courses.

Mark Zuckerberg launches the Facebook.com and right off the bat from the moment somebody logs in, the functionality is like awesome.

So the registration page reads, you can use the Facebook to search for people at your school, find out who are in your classes, course match, look up your friends friends, buddy zoo, see a visualization of your entire social network, buddy zoo plus graphics.

And then at the bottom of every page is the famous copyright 2004 the Facebook on Mark Zuckerberg production.

Awesome.

I feel like it''s like one of the most infamous screenshots is the screenshot of that original homepage.

So so great.

So importantly, things that did not exist here yet, messages, wall posts, even I don''t think pokes were in the original very first version.

That''s a good question.

If they weren''t in the very first version, they launched pretty quickly thereafter.

But no Facebook events, no photos other than your profile photo, I mean, no, I don''t even think status updates were in the very first one.

I don''t think status updates were there yet, no.

But all the lessons from all the other projects, all the elements of them are coming together here.

So, once again, registration is limited to email addresses on the Harvard.edu domain.

That was part of the magic of what had made all the other projects so successful is like, it''s not randos in here.

It''s other people at Harvard, it''s your classmates, it''s the people you care most about.

Yep.

And by the nature of that, it''s the real identities.

And that''s what makes it different than all these other social networks.

MySpace existed, Friendster existed, but anyone could sign up for these.

And in part, that meant that they had more explosive growth because there was no governor on the growth.

And we''ll talk about all the problems that sort of come from anyone anywhere I can sign up at any time.

But the very core thing here is authenticated people.

The people who are signing up for Facebook at the start are people you know go to the same college as you and have to use their real name matched against a university issue to email address.

Identity and authentic identity is a part of the company from its first moment.

Coupled with super important learning number two from face mash, it''s all user-submitted content.

So no pre-population with anything from Harvard, you know, no scraping from Harvard servers, etc.

And like, yeah, on the one hand, that prevents Mark from getting into trouble.

On the other hand, though, it sets the expectation and the requirement and trains the behaviors of the users of you got to enter all the content into this site yourself.

You put in your Amescreen name, you put in your cell phone, you put in your interests, you put in your classes.

is.

Also, isn''t it crazy that they displayed cell phone numbers for the longest time?

Right.

Well, again, think about the functionality and the utility to the users.

On the one hand, you would never disclose your cell phone number to the general public.

On the other hand, other students and your friends at Harvard knowing your cell phone number, well, that''s actually pretty useful for getting in touch, for going out, for going to parties, for planning things, etc.

etc.

These are all people you would give your email and phone number and maybe even birthday too if they just asked.

Totally.

You would probably also give them your relationship status, which is in there.

Formalizing your relationship status for the first time here on the facebook.com.

You can add a photo of your own choosing as your profile picture.

So big difference from old school Facebook''s where it''s whatever the university chooses or it''s a stock school photo or whatever, like, no, you get to express your personality.

You get to Photoshop it as much as you want.

And you can update it whenever you want.

And you can update it whenever you want.

So it is amazing how much of the next billion plus people''s source of value comes from this founding moment.

The Facebook grows tremendously in functionality over time, but everything is like a natural outcropping out of authentic identity, user-submitted content, trust that the people who are seeing this content are people in your sort of private network.

The whole thing is here in this first few weeks of coding that got done and then threw up the landing page.

I would even go one step further than that.

The actual nature of the seeding of the network here is maybe the most important thing.

And here''s what I mean by that.

Once Mark launches this, it takes off like wildfire within Harvard.

Of course, he''s already a celebrity, already known for launching these projects.

People are tuned in, waiting for the next Mark Zuckerberg production.

Within the first 24 hours, 650 people join.

There''s only 2,000 people in a class at Harvard.

So I think there''s about seven or 8,000 undergraduates total.

within two weeks, over half of the entire undergraduate population is active on Facebook.

So now, here''s what I mean and why this seeding is so important.

This initial network is super dense, super engaged and super active.

That not only sets the norms for how you''re going to behave on Facebook going forward, It also means that as the network grows virally, it radiates out from this like nuclear reactor of a base.

Contrast that with an approach of something like Forenster that''s default open to everybody backed by Silicon Valley venture dollars trying to grow.

They''re doing marketing, okay, let''s say somebody in Ohio hears about Forenster somehow maybe they see an ad for it.

they sign up.

When they join the service, there''s no friends there.

There''s nothing to do.

Right.

There''s no functionality.

It''s not alive.

When you join the Facebook, even though it''s limited to just Harvard students, you sign up and you''re like blown away by how alive this site is.

Right.

Almost nobody can use the Facebook, but for the people who can, it''s an unbelievably great experience.

As they expanded, that stayed true.

It was either you''re not allowed to use it, or if you are, it''s blown away great instantly.

That''s basically always true.

And the moments when Facebook stops growing is when that''s not true.

And then they sort of refocus on it, and then that gets the growth back.

Here''s another thing that I think was really important about this seating of Facebook was actually that it happened at Harvard.

Harvard is the top global brand among universities.

Whatever you personally think about Harvard, it''s undeniable, especially back then, that it was like the top.

If you were a kid or a family pretty much anywhere in the world, you knew what Harvard was.

This was really important as Facebook expanded because it had this patina to it.

It was like elite, especially as they grew.

There were clones.

There were lots of other Facebook copies out there.

And even if they were as good as what Mark had built, they didn''t start at Harvard.

It''s kind of like civilization.

Nobody else could ever invade Facebook''s turf, but they could invade other people''s turf.

So somebody put it to me in the research.

There was a fairly big competitor in Germany.

I think maybe called study vice or something like that.

yeah, Facebook could really easily go into Germany and people in Germany would be like, oh, Facebook, I''ve heard of that.

This is interesting.

Study Vice could never go into Boston like ever.

Hmm.

Interesting.

Now that''s a great point.

Okay.

So like weeks go by and they''ve saturated Harvard.

And not only that, you start seeing this thing happen, which just to the level with listeners.

This stayed true for several years.

This is a crazy stat.

70% of people who ever signed up were active that day.

There are not user engagement retention metrics better than that in the world.

The fact that as they grew, it didn''t matter how many more people they added, it was still the case that 70% of users ever were daily active.

And so you have this crazy situation at Harvard, where it''s just like, to your point, nuclear reactor levels engaging.

In fact, this term wouldn''t get coined till later in the summer, but this is from the Facebook effect, David Kirkpatrick''s book.

They had coined a term for how students seem to use a site.

Zuckerberg, Moskowitz, and Parker, who will talk about who comes in, called it the trance.

Once you start combing through the Facebook, it was very easy to keep going.

It was hypnotic.

you just keep clicking and clicking and clicking from profile to profile viewing the data.

And every single one of those clicks is a page view.

So yeah, this hits Harvard like an earthquake.

It''s face-mash all over again except a good problem, not a bad problem.

It''s all legit.

The servers are melting down.

Even Mark is blown away by how big this thing gets so quickly.

Yeah.

Right away they add the wall.

So there''s a way to publicly post things like testimonials on your friends'' walls.

You could view a wall the wall so you could see that public posts that you were making back and forth to each other so that you''ve got your profile information, wall posts, and that''s it.

Yeah.

But to your point, very quickly, Mark is adding features, adding functionality, adding things to do to the site.

The other thing that he does right off the bat is say, okay, we''re taking this to other colleges too.

So he recruits his roommates.

Dustin Moskovitz comes on to help maintain the site.

Dustin was actually an econ major.

He had no idea how to code.

He goes out and buys Pearl for dummies.

And Mark''s like, that''s great that you read that.

The site is written in PHP.

So Dustin goes and learns PHP too, and helps with coding the site and keeping up with everything.

You know, Pearl, you can learn PHP.

It''s much easier.

Chris Hughes joins too, Angie McCollum joins, and then they need to keep buying servers to keep up with the traffic or else everything is going to melt down.

So, one of Mark''s fraternity brothers in A.

Pies, a guy named Eduardo Saverin, and Eduardo was, I think, part of the business and investing club at Harvard.

So, they recruited Eduardo in and Eduardo invests $1,000 in infrastructure for the site.

Mark invests another $1,000, so together there''s $2,000 of investment in the Facebook.com.

The deal they strike is that Mark gets two-thirds of the company, and Eduardo gets one-third of the company, and Eduardo sets up a business entity to formalize all of this as a Florida LLC.

Eduardo was from Florida.

Right away, as we were saying, Mark''s like, great, this is not just a Harvard thing.

We need to bring it to other colleges.

And he specifically chooses Colombia because, Ben, as you said, there was an existing competitor there.

And he''s like, I want to see how Facebook competes.

And like, I want to know right away, can we displace it?

It''s so interesting.

He doesn''t go to the schools where there''s nothing.

He goes to the schools where there is something and wants to be better than it.

Which is so counterintuitive to how most people would think they say, like, oh no, this is a race.

I''m going to go to the white space.

I''m going to gobble everything up and then wait to take on competitors when I''m bigger and stronger like Mike''s like, nope, right away.

This is a early mindset of we are going to be globally dominant.

If you''re okay splitting the market, you go for the white space and then you say, let''s see how much of the low-hanging fruit we can easily get.

But if you''re Facebook, you''re going to say, let''s go to the hardest possible competitor, extinguish them and then we will have a better shot at owning the whole market and we can get to the low-hanging fruit later.

By the way, their strategy once they did win at a school like Columbia was to go figure out all the schools that were like closest to Columbia in terms of network connections and then win there too to kind of like build a moat around their victory.

Yep.

So there we have the initial crew, Mark, Dustin, Chris, Andrew, and Eduardo, the five co-founders of Facebook.

book.

The other interesting thing about going to Columbia, which they do three weeks after the launch at Harvard, 22 days, it was the same month all within February 2004.

They set up Columbia as a completely different network than Harvard.

So if you join the Columbia Facebook, you can''t then go access all the profiles of Harvard students.

right?

At first there was zero connectivity between the two, which is another sort of counterintuitive thing.

You''d think like, oh, great.

I want to build this as big as possible.

Mark clearly wants to conquer all these other schools.

The best way to do that is to have all this alive content come right to them from Harvard.

I think he realized that had he done that, it would have socially inhibited sharing within Harvard.

Yeah.

The scarce commodity is trust.

That is the important lesson here.

It''s also a very convenient infrastructure decision where if these two systems truly don''t need to talk to each other, that''s great.

Put different servers in different data centers.

Don''t worry about overloading the database.

Don''t worry about number of rights per second and reads per second.

It''s great.

If every school gets its own server rack, you''d end up not having some of these issues that the other social networks have.

Friendsters out there trying to compute second-degree friends of friends, which is this crazy hard computer science problem, especially as the global number of people growing.

It''s an n-squared problem, and Facebook is over here, or the Facebook at the time, in the land where they''re keeping n small.

So even anything that''s n-squared is contained within that school, and their servers aren''t falling over and taking 20 plus seconds to load pages the way that the friendsters of the world are.

This is such an interesting point because technology infrastructure advantage has always been a core part of Facebook even back to this very beginning.

What''s interesting is that it flips at some point.

As Facebook grows and eventually becomes open to everybody, their competitive advantage becomes their tech is so good and their infrastructure is so good that they can do everything you we were just talking about that friends that couldn''t do and that my space couldn''t do.

But in these early days, their competitive advantage is actually like, no, we''re scale out, not scale up.

And then Mark was totally willing to just flip the bit later.

Right, it''s effectively counter positioning.

They''re building the Facebook in such a way that the use cases don''t require incredibly sophisticated technology to accomplish those feature sets.

There''s this funny chicken of the egg thing here, and I think the answer like many chicken of the egg is both.

Mark at the moment he conceives of an idea, thinks through the technical requirements and the user experience, and they''re sort of co-mingled in the product development process.

And so I really do think even at age 19, he was sort of aware of the scaling benefits in addition to the user experience benefits of launching in this way.

Totally agree.

Okay, fun bit of trivia about Harvard''s leave policy that we referenced earlier.

Do you know what else Mark does on the same evening that they launched Columbia?

No idea.

He goes to hear Bill Gates speak on campus.

That was the same night.

The same night during which speech Bill mentions that he actually felt comfortable dropping out of Harvard because he discovered that Harvard had this really generous leave policy that you could take an infinite leave of absence and pursue something else and come back anytime you want.

And Mark would actually say later that Bill saying that at the event was part of what got him comfortable doing the same thing.

Unbelievable.

It is crazy tying this back to our Microsoft episode.

This would have been what early 2004.

And so this would have been right after Bill stopped being CEO, handed the CEO reins to Steve.

He was still the chief architect and still chairman of the board, but it''s sort of this like post DOJ time for Microsoft where Bill is just technically focused and can do things like go speak at Harvard.

Yeah, it is amazing how much influence Microsoft had on Facebook and on Mark.

We have a lot more to talk about on that front.

So next couple days after Columbia launches, Facebook launches at Stanford at Yale, by the end of the semester, they''re in over 100 schools in like, you know, what, three, four months.

Like the speed they''re moving with is crazy.

And they start building these wait lists.

I mean, this is the other, there''s so many common startup things that Facebook kind of invented.

they built tremendous demand before they would light up the network.

They knew that as soon as you''re in Facebook, you want to quickly get to seven friends, or 10 friends, or whatever the metric is to create that magic moment where you''re like, oh, yeah, Facebook now works for me.

So they wanted to wait until they had sufficient demand to boom open that school.

And then once it''s open, everybody should have the best possible experience.

And so you''re seeing Facebook basically say, okay, wherever there''s really strong demand that''s where we''ll open next and we''re not going to open anywhere where we see like, you know, middleing demand for our product.

Yep, totally.

Meanwhile, here we are at the end of the school year.

The Winkelvast twins take the whole connect you situation to Harvard''s president Larry Summers to adjudicate this dispute between them and Mark.

Larry says, Hey, Harvard is not going to get involved here.

This is a business dispute between students, eventually the two twins Sue, Mark, and Facebook, they set all for $65 million, $45 million of which is paid in pre-IPO.

Facebook stock, obviously that grows a large portion of that.

Then I think they sell and put into Bitcoin in like 2011, 2012 time frame.

So they end up pretty fine out of all this.

They did great.

They did great.

But here we are at the end of the school year.

Summer comes around and Andrew McCollum has some connections out in the Bay Area.

He had interned at electronic arts.

Adam D''Angelo is going to be spending the summer from Caltech.

So the crew all decides like, hey, great, let''s not get internships.

Let''s go rent a house out in Palo Alto, move to Silicon Valley and work on Facebook there for the summer and see what happens.

And yes, the house did indeed have a pool.

Yes, they did indeed install a zip line off the chimney.

That was not fiction in the movie that did actually happen.

And it is important to know, to this point, it is a project.

Mark and Dustin and Chris and everyone who moves out, they are there to work on a project that they think is cool and seems to be working and get exposure to Silicon Valley and venture capitalists for when they start their start-up having a network.

That is literally the mentality.

Facebook is live at how many schools, David?

A hundred.

A hundred schools.

And they are going out not with the intent to make this a company but to contemplate what company they could start and meet people that can help them with that.

Yeah.

Now when we say crew who moves out, that crew did not include Eduardo.

So Eduardo had an internship in New York and decided that he was not going to move out for the summer.

Yeah.

Tough decision.

Not a great decision.

On the other hand, he ends up with 2% of Facebook, so he''s also fun.

Yeah.

So to make a long story short, yes, everything you saw in the social network around this, the result is effectively correct.

That Eduardo Saverin goes from owning a third of this Florida based LLC to something like two percent of this C-Corp that is a Delaware C-Corp based in California that goes on to become or is Facebook Inc.

And the justification that they effectively use in changing this structure is, hey, a bunch of us moved California to start a company together.

You stayed back and yes, you sold some ads in the meantime, but like you didn''t come start the company with us.

Listener, we leave it to you to sort of decide how that should have played out and what''s fair.

none of us were there.

He was a co-founder of Facebook and then ended up with 2% and lived on a different coast.

Okay, so they''re in California.

They get really serious about the Facebook.

They actually are still working on something else called Wirehog concurrently within the same team, but they''re starting to realize, okay, this is the Facebook thing really, really has legs.

And as they''re sort of contemplating their next move, they literally run into someone on the street who will change everything.

David, who is this person?

That person is the co-founder of Napster, Sean Parker, who would have a brief but very, very large impact on the company.

Yes.

So before we tell the Sean Parker chapter of the Facebook, now is a great time to talk about our presenting partner, JP Morgan Payments.

In these critical moments, like we were talking about now, where a new paradigm or technology shift happens, David and I typically focus on the founders and the innovators who figure out how to build something really great, but unfortunately it''s not just the good actors who take advantage of these opportunities.

Oh yeah, there are always bad actors on the other side of the same new technology, and this is especially true whenever money or value is exchanged, whether it be phone scammers taking advantage of international networks in the 80s and 90s, viruses spreading through or the early internet, or today''s cybercrime, like AI-powered identity theft, as technology gets smarter so will the fraud tactics.

Enter JP Morgan payments.

With the digital payments ecosystem expanding rapidly through innovations like real-time payments, blockchain, and peer-to-peer networks, the attack surface has grown exponentially.

For a company like JP Morgan, who moves $10 trillion a day across 160 countries, staying ahead of bad actors is critical for the entire global financial system.

That''s why they''ve been investing in technology like AI and cyber fraud prevention for years.

Their AI models have been trained on billions of transactions that is unparalleled scale and expertise when it comes to fraud intelligence.

And it''s only getting smarter and more reliable given their processing over 5,000 transactions per second with 99.9% accuracy.

Regardless of your size or industry, you can leverage their enterprise grade solutions like validation services, which validates bank accounts, individuals, and businesses.

One great example is a Fortune 500 global media company.

They needed an automated solution for the thousands of influencers on their platform to do rapid onboarding, minimize errors, and ensure consistent validation of bank account information.

They were able to compress validation times from days to minutes so they could scale.

They''ve got a great payments developer portal.

It''s a trusted, scalable platform built with payment security and risk management in mind.

developers can even integrate their preventative fraud solutions to act before an incident takes place.

Sardine, a leader in financial crime prevention, collaborates with JPMorgan payments and embeds its account validation services API to analyze and protect over two billion devices for 300 companies with AI to the highest standards of fraud and compliance safety.

David, I actually met the founder of Sardine at the meetup that we did after the Chase Center event with JPMorgan payments in San Francisco last month.

That''s right.

It was awesome.

Ultimately, every business benefits from built-in fraud prevention, whether you''re moving $100 or $1 billion, and with the trust and innovation from JP Morgan payments whole ecosystem, you can drive growth while protecting your business.

Okay, David.

Sean Parker enters the picture.

Here we go.

So Sean Parker had of course started Napster with Sean Fanning back in the late 1990s.

And after the whole Napster saga, Parker ended up starting the email contact list company called Plaxo, which was kind of its own proto-social network and pioneered email address book exploitation and exporting.

Which is how every social company got its start.

Facebook did a ton of this, LinkedIn did a ton of this, what''s app did this?

Exactly.

It pioneered the first bootstrap viral social network mechanic.

Hey, let me see who all the people you know are, so that on this new thing, that you want to be connected to all the people you know, you''re connected to all the people you know.

Oh, by the way, we might also invite all the people that you''ve ever contacted.

Yep.

So Sean and his co-founders at Plaxo, raise money for Plexo from venture capitalists.

And not just any venture capitalists, the best venture capitalists from Sequoia capital.

And all is going well, Plexo''s going fine.

Sir Michael Moritz is on the board of the company.

Anyway, after a couple of years, Sean Parker ends up getting kicked out of the company by the board.

Now, Sean wasn''t exactly the most like reliable employee and definitely was quirky.

But the result of this is Sean''s everlasting enmity for Sequoia and paranoid distrust of all venture capitalists and company boards.

This is going to become very, very, very important here in ASEC.

So rewind slightly back to the spring of 2004 when the team is still at Harvard.

Sean is living in Palo Alto, and one of his housemates, Girlfriends, who''s, I believe, a student at Stanford, pulls up the Facebook.com on her laptop.

And it''s kind of like the scene where this happens in the social network movie.

Sean is like, holy crap.

This is it.

This is the winning social network.

And Sean, I believe, had actually been an advisor to Friendster as well.

So he was like between Plexo and Napster, Friendster, really believed social networking was going to become a thing.

Totally.

And it is kind of crazy to think about unless you had a student show you on their computer, this is what Facebook is, there''s no real way for you to know other than the sign-up page.

Right.

Which you can''t get past it and see how alive the thing is.

Yep.

So Sean, being the enterprising person that he is, He cold emails the company''s business email address and asked to set up a meeting and Eduardo Saverin replies to Sean is like, oh cool, you''re the co-founder of Navster.

Yeah.

They set up a dinner in New York City.

This is while the spring semester is still going on at Harvard and Mark and Eduardo and Sean all get dinner together and Mark and Sean really bond.

Mark is super pumped to meet him.

But that''s about it, like there''s no, you know, discussion about, you know, what''s cool, a billion dollars, you know, et cetera, et cetera, as dramatized in the movie, that doesn''t happen.

They kind of think that they''re just going to go their separate ways.

Right.

Nice to meet you.

I don''t think even Mark knows yet that he''s moving to California this summer.

No, totally not.

So here we are now in June.

The Facebook crew has moved out to Palo Alto.

know, they''re walking down the street one evening.

Sean is also walking down the same street in Palo Alto, sees them and is like, Hey, it''s the Facebook guys.

And at this point, Sean Parker was living in a different house, specifically the house of his girlfriend''s parents, not a good situation.

And he makes a split second decision right there on the industry to insert himself into Facebook and is like, hey, I''m actually looking for a place to stay.

Do you think I can crash with you guys in the crash pad for the summer?

And he joins the crew.

And this is how it all starts.

That is wild.

Yeah, it''s like a, you ever play old school, like Super Nintendo, role playing games, like Japanese RPGs, like Final Fantasy or whatnot?

it''s been a while.

I mean, it''s just like you meet somebody on the street and they join the party and like, you know, you always know the character on the street that''s going to join the party because their pixel sprite is more highly detailed than the regular NPC picks.

I mean, this is exactly what it is like here.

Sean Parker had a very detailed pixel sprite.

Yes.

So while he''s there, you know, living in the house, crashing with the college students, he basically takes Mark aside and he''s like, Look, you''ve got something really special here.

I have been in your shoes.

Let me tell you exactly what is gonna happen this summer.

You have created something magical.

You''re now out here in Silicon Valley.

You are going to be the bell of the ball.

All the venture capitalists out here, all the big companies, they''re gonna wine and dine you.

They''re gonna court you.

They''re gonna tell you you''re great and they''re gonna wanna invest in your company.

And then they''re going to turn around and they are going to screw you.

They''re going to take control of your board.

They''re going to force you to bring in, quote, unquote, professional management.

They''re going to kill all the magic.

Growth is going to slow.

Then they''re going to blame you.

And then they''re going to fire you.

And then they''re going to put the company up for sale.

And here''s the thing.

To this point in history, he really wasn''t wrong.

He was absolutely right.

There wasn''t founders fund yet.

There wasn''t a 16z yet.

there wasn''t like the notion of founder friendliness.

What venture capitalists did is they invested in founders companies and then brought in management to take them to the next level.

It''s what happened at eBay.

It''s what happened at Google.

This is a pattern that happened over and over and over again.

And usually they would try to do it with the sort of help and support of the entrepreneur to build this like really great team together.

But oftentimes that backfired and And they just hot swapped the CEO with a big grown-up manager and a nice suit.

Yep.

And that was not the wrong playbook until this moment in time, because as we''ve been talking about, until now, if you wanted to scale something you needed money, you needed permission, you needed business people, you needed deals, you needed contacts.

Yeah.

That''s true.

The open web kind of changed the hard requirement on that.

Yes, and I think Sean, as bitter as he was about his own experience, I think he probably also recognized that and recognized that the Facebook and Mark had the potential to start a new paradigm of how to do this differently.

So Sean says to Mark, look, if you just go out on your own, that''s what''s going to happen.

I am going to take you under my wing and make sure that that does not happen.

and I''m going to help you reset up the company so that you permanently control the board and no one can ever fire you because you are what is important here.

And I''m going to help you go about fundraising but I''m going to make sure we find the right people who are cool with that stipulation number one because if you go try and do it by yourself like you don''t know enough, you don''t know these people, you''re not going to find the right folks.

and it''s kind of wild.

I mean, Sean was also in a position to take advantage of Mark and the company, and he didn''t.

There was some nice self-interest in all of this.

It''s not like this was like charitable.

He ends up being the president of Facebook.

And he ends up with a pretty decent chunk for a non-founder and he ends up with a board seat.

Now granted, it''s technically Mark''s board seat, but Sean''s the one sitting in it.

Totally, but it would have been really easy for him to do one or two things.

You know, one obviously take advantage of Mark in the company and get a lot more for himself.

Two, I think he also could have been so jaded by the Plexo experience to say we shouldn''t raise venture capital at all.

But actually what he counsels Mark to do is the right thing.

No, we should raise venture capital.

We should professionalize and the whole Silicon Valley machinery really can help us, but we''re gonna do it in the right way on our terms.

Yep.

I think he just really wanted to help Mark win the game.

I think you''re right.

The other thing that Sean does by all accounts is, he makes sure that everyone in the house that summer gets equity in the company.

Okay, so what''s Wirehog?

What''s the second project that''s going on here?

Yes.

I really would love to know what Sean thought when Mark and the crew told them about Wirehug.

Wirehug was basically going to be a captive Napster to Facebook.

Everybody on Facebook, in these private networks, walled gardens, what is something that college students really, really wanted to do and was happening internally on college servers all the time?

Share files, share music, share movies.

Wirehug was going to be a product to make this happen.

And actually, legend has it.

I think in Stephen Levy''s book, while they''re talking about this Sean Parker actually comes up with a name for the product, it''s like, oh, if you launch this, you should actually call it Dropbox.

No way.

Yeah, like a year before Dropbox, the actual company gets founded.

That''s so funny.

But they really are sort of thinking of themselves.

This is almost like incubator lab.

I don''t really understand how this is true, but they really did convince themselves at their current front runner for the product they were most excited about was wirehog.

And Facebook might be like a good distribution vehicle for it, or maybe at some point they don''t even focus on Facebook anymore and they go all in on wirehog.

And they''re actively talking about this insanity while speaking with investors about raising capital.

Yes.

So to the investors that Sean goes out and helps them find.

Sean at this point knows basically everybody and Silicon Valley.

And he''s like, okay, I need the pretty tight window of people who A have money, B know what they''re doing, and C are okay with our terms that Mark is going to control the board and control the company.

So we need an individual, not an institution.

So he calls two angel investors, who he knows pretty well, and he thinks might be the right fit.

One is Reid Hoffman, who Reid had been running LinkedIn, and Sean had been in this early social networking thing.

And he just started LinkedIn. They actually knew each other because Reed was an early investor in Friendster.

So Sean calls up Reed.

And he also calls up Mark Pinkis.

Mark had been Sean''s boss at an internship that he had in high school.

And then Mark had gone on to invest in Napster when they started Napster as a company.

And we should say who Mark Pinkis is for anyone who doesn''t know.

Mark would eventually start Zingha.

Yes.

It could become a very important person and company in the Facebook ecosystem.

The maker of Farmville.

Yes.

So, Pinkis and Reed meet up with Sean and Mark and they''re just blown away by the Facebook.

And Ben, as you say, Mark starts talking about wirehog and apparently Reed is like, no, no, no, stop talking about this wirehog thing.

I''m running LinkedIn. I can tell you this is special.

Do the Facebook thing.

Not only do the Facebook thing, but music is kryptonite as a space right now, because of what Napster did to the music labels.

How is Sean not the one being like, stay a thousand yards away from music, my God.

I mean, amazingly a couple years later, Sean being so open-minded, I mean, he was one of the ones he really helped Spotify get going.

Yep.

And really broker the relationship with Mark for Daniel and Mark to hit it off and obviously the Spotify to have a huge amount of growth on Facebook.

Totally.

So, okay, read.

Real excited.

He''s like, no, the Facebook, focus on the Facebook.

Your user numbers are what?

Your engagement is what?

Your retention is what?

Your Dow Mauritio is what?

Oh my God.

So, reads like, look, I''m running LinkedIn. Pinkist and I don''t have that much money together.

We''ll give you some, but we can''t fund a whole round for you.

And they''re kind of conflicted, Both with Friendster and LinkedIn, but he''s like, I think I know the perfect person who can put this together I worked with this guy at PayPal My old colleague from PayPal who actually as luck would have it is Thinking about starting his own venture capital fund.

This could be a really good fit Why don''t you meet Peter teal And Peter, yes, indeed, was just in the process of starting what would become Founder''s Fund.

Ben, you already alluded to this, but like, Founder''s Fund was such a radical idea when Peter started it.

The idea being baked into the name that they will always side with founders and never push a founder out of a company.

I was shocked.

I mean, it just, it''s so easy to forget this, but it was just 20 years ago.

So the idea that a venture capitalist makes an investment in a company and they are not the controlling shareholder was blasphemous just 20 years ago.

Totally blasphemous.

Of course PayPal has its own crazy history where you can understand why Peter would arrive at this conclusion, but he really was like maybe the only person in Silicon Valley that hit that Venn diagram that I talked about a minute ago of like super legitimate would would actually help the company and help them navigate Silicon Valley had money because the PayPal ex had just happened and was going to be cool with Mark controlling the company.

Yeah.

It''s a one of one intro to make.

I mean, it probably would have had to be someone else in the PayPal mafia that kind of fits that.

Yep.

But I don''t think at that time, you know, Elon wasn''t doing investing.

I don''t think there was anybody else who really could have done it.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That''s a crazy counterfactual thinking about if Elon had invested in Facebook instead of Peter Teal.

Right.

What if Elon hadn''t started SpaceX?

He wasn''t just as good a position.

Totally.

Had Rulof gone to Sequoia yet?

If he had, he would have just started.

This is effectively the pool of financiers who could have done this deal.

All right.

But Sequoia wasn''t going to do this deal under those terms, so Rulof couldn''t have done it.

Yep.

It was maybe one of two with the other one potentially being Elon.

Wow, that would be a really different world that we would be living in today.

Yep.

Okay.

So they take the idea to Peter.

In the meeting, Reed brings along a young guy who''s working for him at LinkedIn, a Matt Kohler, and come help, you know, talk to Peter, evaluate this from an investing standpoint.

point, they strike a deal that Peter is going to lead around of $500,000.

Read and Mark Pinkis are each going to invest $37,500.

Peter is going to do the rest at a $5 million pre-money valuation.

So $5.5 million post.

Which you know on the woodhead is like laughable now.

On the other hand, at this point in time, for a bunch of kids who started this a couple months ago, it''s crazy that this would be worth $5 million.

Out of $5 million valuation, the multiple cents then has been about $250,000 x.

So that takes us to the end of the summer.

So everybody now has to make a decision.

Do they stay in Palo Alto and keep working full time on Facebook?

Or do they go back to school?

So Eduardo never came out in the first place, so he did his internship in New York.

He goes back to Harvard and starts his junior year.

Chris Hughes also goes back to Harvard, starts his junior year, graduates in 2006 and then rejoins Facebook after graduation.

Andrew McCullum stays in Palo Alto for a couple years and then goes back to Harvard later and completes his degree, he takes the Bill Gates road, not traveled option.

Dustin never goes back, stays with the company until 2008 when he leaves to start Asana, and Mark, I think, probably never really even considered going back.

Yeah, at this point, the 70% stat keeps being true.

Despite the fact that they keep opening all these new schools, it keeps being true that 70% of people who have ever signed up are daily active users.

So I think Mark realizes, oh, I have created one of the most engaging technology applications ever.

Yes.

And certainly at this point, the combination of Sean, Peter, Reed, Mark Pinkis, all advising and being part of the company, if they know, and they have certainly helped him realize that.

Adam D''Angelo does go back to Caltech, and then through AM, I guess, remotely helps collaborate with the company until he graduates, and in 2006, and becomes CTO, officially.

Got it.

Sean, like we said, his impact on the company was huge.

I really want to underscore this again, Mark having full control over the company as we are going to see time and time and time again as we go through the story here makes all the difference in the world.

And that is one hundred percent because of Sean Parker.

Yep.

So how long is Sean at the company?

Not very long, because at some point in time, the next spring.

So it''s like nine total months at the company.

Yeah, I think about nine total months.

Sean ends up leaving the company after charges get filed against him as a result of some drug incidents at a house party during a trip to North Carolina.

Charges do eventually get dropped, But in the meantime, the decision is made, hey, this is not something the company is going to get sucked into.

Yeah.

He immediately joins where else founders fund, which Peter, partially on the back of this Facebook investment has now set up and raised officially.

And like we said, Sean goes on to find and fund and really help nurture Spotify through his role of founders fund.

Yep, it''s kind of amazing thinking about founders fund raising capital on the back of this investment one pitches We invested in Facebook.

The flip side of it is we just invested in a company We''re currently holding it flat because there''s been no markup yet from any other investors and they''re not generating any revenue Well, let''s talk about other investors by this point kind of towards the end of spring semester to 2005.

Facebook had now dropped the the become just Facebook.

That was one of Sean Parker''s final impacts on the companies.

He actually negotiated the domain name purchase of Facebook.com.

I didn''t know that.

Yeah.

I believe they bought it for $200,000.

Which actually was a good chunk of that venture money.

Yeah.

Right.

Because it was 500K that raised before.

It was 500K.

Yep.

And they''re actively spending that.

The company has never consumed that much capital, but they are having to spend it on servers.

As they stand up new colleges, they are having to go into data centers and rack servers or rent servers on a monthly basis, and the server bills are starting to add up, especially as they scaled to how many schools were they add in the fall of 2004?

Several hundred.

Well, Sean Parker introduced Mark to Western technology investment, WTI, the debt fund, yeah.

Yeah.

And so they basically invented venture debt.

And so they make a $300,000 loan.

It''s like, I think like a revolving credit line in the fall of 2004.

And that comes with warrants that if the company ever goes public that they can then exercise, they do a deal again, the next spring for another $300,000.

So they''re in for $600,000.

I spoke with someone years ago who told me this ended up being phenomenally, phenomenally successful and the warrant exercise on this, I think is the greatest venture debt deal of all time.

Has to be.

Nice.

Spring 2005, Excel comes in, leads a series A, $12.7 million at a $98 million post money evaluation.

That''s sort of like crazy in and of itself for the time.

And though, still being okay with Mark having board control.

Yes.

Which, you know, one thing for like, okay, at the angel round, maybe like that''s still pretty crazy, but whatever, this is the angel round.

But like, no, like a real venture capital firm, real series, a 2005, $800 million dollar valuation, be being okay with that.

That was wild.

Oh, also C, getting less than 20% of the company.

Yes.

Like, rule of thumb venture investing back in the day was you need at least 20% of the company, ideally more like 25 or 30.

Yes.

So, Kevin Fruci who ran down the deal and did the diligence at Excel and Jim Breyer, who was the partner and took the board seat.

This is one of the all time great venture investments.

And so it''s worth talking about some of the deal mechanics.

It was the very first post.com institutional venture capital deal where the founder maintained control.

Certainly the norm was as soon as a VC gets involved.

It is a VC controlled board and company.

The other thing that''s worth noting is this is a company getting a $98 million valuation.

Now the silly land that we live in now are like this happens all the time.

This didn''t happen.

And we were only just coming out of the dot com era.

So eyeballs and clicks had just had four years of demonization from everyone from the press to the public to limited partners.

In fact, Excel had limited partners drop out of this fund who were LPs previously, including your beloved Princeton, including Harvard.

I mean, big and I think Stanford was one of the only ones that really stuck with them for this $400 million fund, and they''re kind of looking at this realizing this might be one of the greatest companies of all time, and we are going to have to do the type of deal that everyone got raked over the coals for five years ago in the mania for doing, and no one is doing this type of deal in this environment.

But it''s Facebook, so we''re going to do it.

I think the level of risk and reputation risk that that they took on this cannot be underscored enough.

Totally.

I was trying to think of, were there any other deals like this that you could even kind of point to as a comparable from the past, and the only one I can think of was the Google Series A, which was $25 million at a $100 million post-money valuation split between Michael Moritz from Sequoia and John Doar from Kleiner Perkins.

But it was in the .com run-up.

Exactly, exactly.

It was a totally, totally different paradigm and the legend has it, I don''t know if this is apocryphal or not, is that after making the investment, more it''s told Don Valentine, it''s Sequoia, never have we paid so much for so little.

And I think he was actually referring to the small amount of equity that they got by having to split the deal in Google.

So yeah, in the dot com bubble that happened, but like that this would happen in 2005.

Excel went way out on a limb for this.

Yeah, so some other interesting deal points, $1.1 million of this $12.7 million round was done by Jim Breyer personally.

Wow.

Yeah.

The shares were acquired at 4.5 cents per share.

Facebook just recently hit $600 a share.

So Excel and their limited partners and Jim, for anyone who''s still holding the shares after they distributed them, that is a 13,000X return.

Another interesting thing on this, do you know the whole Don Graham dynamic with this deal?

Yes.

The original deal was that Don Graham from the Washington Post was going to invest in it wasn''t going to be a VC deal.

That was at a $60 million valuation.

Excel comes in over the top And in part of the negotiation to get it up to this $98 million deal, there was actually a secondary.

Oh, wow.

Three million went to Mark, Dustin, and Sean as a secondary in this deal.

Wow.

I had no idea.

Yep.

Well, I mean, add to the litany of things that were not done back then.

This is Facebook having all the leverage and full deal control in negotiating this series A Wow, and still it was one of the best venture capital investments of all time Absolutely, man, that is freaking wild.

Yeah Wow, okay, well that is a lot of hype to live up to Which brings us now to the summer of 2005 where Mark motivated by this perhaps, I hadn''t quite thought about that, announces to the company his product road map for the summer.

And it is a six-point product plan.

Number one, a redesign of the site.

Bye-bye, Facebook guy.

Number two, a photo application.

Which, by the way, photos got written by like one guy in two weeks.

Yes, move fast and break things.

Yep.

Number three, a personalized newspaper based on all of your friends'' activity.

Number four, an events feature.

Number five, a local business product.

And number six, a sort of vague idea for a feature called I''m Board, which would let users on the site who were bored consume media and play games.

That''s a pretty big feature mandate.

This is a freaking wild.

So now, okay, of that, I think only the redesign and photos would actually ship in 2005.

Maybe events did too, I''m not entirely sure, but this is incredible.

Photos, newsfeed, platform, which is really what this I''m bored feature is.

Summer 2005, it''s all right there in the vision.

and Mark thinks they can accomplish all of this by the end of the summer.

And the wild thing is they do accomplish all of this in the next two years, which two big points on this.

For any other company, these are all like multi-year long development processes.

Well, any one is its own company.

Exactly.

Photos is flicker.

There are independent didn''t game platform companies out there.

Many clip, et cetera.

Yeah, flash games.

What were some of the other ones?

Events, event bright.

Yep.

Personalized newspaper.

Well, that becomes a true, true innovation in newsfeed.

But I think at the time there was a lot of buzz and talk about personalized portals and Yahoo was really big on this.

And Google was even kind of big on this.

Like, oh, make this your homepage.

Oh, I, Google.

Do you remember I, Google?

Yes, I, Google.

Exactly.

And I think that might have been somewhat of the inspiration, although obviously Mark was thinking way bigger than that, but like, yeah, again, local business product, Yelp.

Each one of these under the old paradigm was its own company, and Mark was like, no, this is all part of Facebook, crazy, super crazy.

And this really, I think, speaks to the genius of Mark as a product strategist.

It''s one thing to say I''m going to add a lot of random features to my site, and I''m going to throw spaghetti against the wall.

This was not a random grouping of features.

Everything reinforced one another and drove the engagement loop of the site.

So just as one example, let''s take from this roadmap that Mark lays out, events.

Let''s start there.

events and parties, planned on Facebook, get tagged with who''s going to attend the events.

All of those tags get published out as activity to newsfeed.

That drives interest in FOMO among the friend networks, so more friends come to the actual event.

At the event, photos get taken, and now there''s more people there.

Well, those photos get posted back to the site afterwards and they all get tagged with the people who were there who are in the photos.

All of that becomes activity that they can get published to newsfeed.

That generates more desire from more people who see that on Facebook in the newsfeed to either engage with the photos and like and comment on them, or if they''re hearing about it from their friends and they''re not yet on Facebook to now register for Facebook and get involved in this loop.

All of that now gets published back to newsfeed.

So now it''s time for the next party, and you can see how this just grows and builds on itself over and over and over again.

It''s funny, as you''re saying all this, it sounds like very old hat, like almost boring.

Of course it does all of that.

At the time it was so revolutionary.

Everything I just described was there within the next 18 months.

So photos I think was like late summer of05.

Interestingly, photos did not originally include photo tagging.

Photo tagging was like a pretty new concept.

I think Flickr may have had it, but the idea that like you''re tagging a person, and then you can go browse that person''s profile by photos they''ve been tagged in.

That wasn''t brand new innovation.

That is a mechanic that was not thought of in social networks before.

If you think about what Friendster and Myspace were, you could upload a limited set of photos, which by the way, you''d have to delete one to add another.

Yes.

So my space only allowed you to have eight photos maximum at the time, and this is a bend what you''re describing of person tagging in photos Incredible innovation, right that drives the whole viral loop.

And this is a through line through the whole episode What social media or social networks are Definitionally changes every year and often Facebook was the one in the early days to push the envelope and say this is what it means to be a social network.

In the later years, it was Facebook''s competitors that then they had to sort of adopt that functionality.

But the idea that a social network includes an infinite number of photos that you can tag and give XY coordinates on the photo to map to a specific person that is another entity in the social network, that was actually a new component to what it meant to be a social network.

And as you''re saying with newsfeed, that wouldn''t happen for another, what was that late summer of 2006 or something?

September 2006.

Yeah, so another year, year and a half after this, that completely turned what social media, social networking was on its head again.

Yes, we''re going to talk all about it in a sec.

To this point, a social network is a set of static profile pages that you can navigate to.

And if you go to home, like the root, you know, Facebook.com slash, Ash instead of slash profile PHP.

It''s pretty useless.

Like the homepage is actually an uninteresting place to hang out.

There is no, hey, let me see what''s going on in my network.

Yes, until newsfeed.

Okay, but before we get to that, 2005.

To your broader point here though, yeah, for the first six or seven years of its life, Facebook was a change maker, defining what social networking was.

And then after that, it became a change taker.

And we''ll talk about this when it happens, but like, again, the mental flexibility of Mark in the company to be like, okay, I''m not going to have pride about that anymore.

I''m going to adapt and still win.

It was incredible.

Very Microsoftian.

Very Microsoftian.

Okay.

So even this, even though it takes two years to roll out the full roadmap, photos, events, but especially photos.

The 2005-2006 school year is just off the charts for growth, sharing, engagement among college students.

Ben, you found a like incredible stat about Facebook''s page views, right?

Yeah, this stat is crazy.

By November of 2005, they were getting 230 million page views daily, which means that they had passed Google Google.

In page views.

Wow.

Google, the company started six years earlier.

And the reason is because when you''re on Google, you do like one or two searches, and then you go to your destination.

On Facebook, you get caught in an hour''s long trance of looking at everybody you know and what they''re doing, right?

Which was already the case when it was basically text only, but adding photos.

I mean, oh my God, every photo is a page view with such a small user base at that point in time.

I think what probably certainly less than 10 million users to have 200 million plus page views every single day and be passing Google and traffic is wild.

I mean, let''s say it''s 10 million.

It''s 23 page views per day per person.

That''s assuming that every single person who is a monthly user is accessing it every day and loading a page 23 times.

Right.

Right.

In our mobile age now, that doesn''t really sound like much.

I bet the number of photos that someone scrolls through on Instagram is way higher than that.

But for the time that interactivity was just nuts.

I mean, certainly flicker my space, friendster couldn''t hold a candle to that type of engagement.

Yeah.

So here''s their user growth.

In June of 05, as you mentioned, they were at 3 million by September of 05.

They were at 5 million users.

That was 10x their user base just a year ago in September of 04 and almost a third of all US college students were included in that 5 million.

So by September of 05 they had a third of US college students of their 5 million users that they had about 18 months in 70% were daily active 85% were weekly actively active, 93% were monthly active.

Wow.

Those are just insane numbers.

Yes.

I could go on and on and on.

But one interesting thing to also point out at this period of time, October of 2005, they were up to 8.3 million users.

They were the 10th most visited site on the internet.

But the important part is they were doing a million dollars a month in revenue.

They had actually started figuring out the advertising business model.

So here we are 19 months after founding there no longer burning capital.

Yes.

Well, when you say figured out the advertising business model They just had such a high volume of page views that they didn''t have to figure anything out Right, you just plug in some crappy ad networks and like print money.

Fair.

Yeah, you''re right Actually, I completely misspoke.

I would say that they were nowhere near figuring out the advertising business model But they had a traffic machine.

They were able to, through alchemy, turn page views into revenue, but they had not, by any means, figured out their business model.

And in this world where startups glorify, raising capital, burning huge amounts of money, delay monetization, and then having these amazing screaming returns when they finally do turn on the money faucet, Facebook was just the opposite.

They lost money and not that much money for like a year and a half and then from that point on they were just profitable.

Yes.

So the 2005-2006 academic school year, incredible for the company.

Everything we just talked about.

But there were a couple yellow flags, shall we say, that popped up.

During that year, Mark, of course, was already starting to think about, So, well, how can this keep getting bigger?

People graduate from college.

This is great in colleges, but like, I don''t want to just build a college site.

I want this to be a lot bigger, and obviously that was what Excel was investing into at that valuation.

So they launched two sort of tests throughout the year.

One was opening up Facebook to high school students, and the other one was opening Facebook book up to workplace groups and both of them kind of flopped.

And for different reasons, right?

The workplace ones, they were like the workplace thing is gonna be awesome because it''s authenticated email addresses, the same way that the colleges had authenticated email addresses.

Most high schools don''t have authenticated email addresses so we expect these workplace networks to work better.

Yep, but the problem was going into workplace networks, people didn''t want to share with their colleagues.

I don''t want some low-res party photos of me from last night showing up on my workplace.

And I think also just the density wasn''t there.

It was violating the principles that got them there of like this thing needs to be alive.

And every way we frackedily spread out needs to be bringing that nuclear reactor of what''s happening along with it.

Going straight into workplaces like you''ve got 60 year olds and they''re like there''s gonna be nothing compelling for them right now.

Well, the extreme bear case on Facebook at this moment in time is you started with the group of people who are the most social and the most open to share in their entire lives.

You''ve already saturated a third of them.

Every single cohort that you add from here is probably going to be worse.

Yep.

And that was a very rational argument.

Now, high schools, as you say, failed for a different reason.

and there wasn''t the same standardized email architecture in high schools across the country.

It was just way more fragment and so you couldn''t elegantly set up these private networks in the same way.

Yeah, and in fact, what they ended up doing because I was in high school at this time, it was technically a different Facebook.

In fact, I will quote the homepage when you went to sign up if you went to Facebook.com in 2006, the title was Facebook as an online directory that connects people through social networks at schools.

Now there are two Facebooks, one for people in colleges, and one for people in high school.

The site is open to a lot of schools, but not everywhere yet.

We''re working on it.

And so if you signed up as a high schooler, you got the crappy one.

You had to log into hs.facebook.com.

And it looked mostly the same.

It had slightly different features.

But there was this weird thing where somebody who was already in college had to invite you.

It''s not like anyone could sign up for high school Facebook.

You needed a college student who went to high school with you to basically vouch for the fact that you are a real high school student And thus eligible to sign out for hs.facebook.com Right.

Oh man, I vaguely remember this of my younger friends who are still in high school asking for this and the subdomaining thing was that lasted for a long time because the college facebooks Were subdomained as a part of their like tech infrastructure you know, harvard.facebook.com only went to the set of servers that they had set up for that.

It made it all really easy from an infrastructure perspective.

I was on hs.facebook.com for a long time as a college student.

Right.

Yeah, because there had to just be one hs.facebook.com for all the high schools.

Yes, exactly.

And it meant that they needed to like manage scale and load balance really differently because very quickly, the largest network, or like certainly the largest subdomain, was the high school one.

And so I''d think like within a month or two of allowing high school signups, you know, high school as a whole was much, much, much larger.

And they had to solve for the technology constraint of what do we do with this?

It doesn''t behave like any of our college networks.

Yeah.

So the academic school year in the core college user segment went great.

But once Once you hit summer 2006, all those kids go on break and college growth stops for the moment.

So summer 2006 was kind of a scary moment for the company.

The initiatives to expand outside colleges were not going super well.

College growth had stopped for the moment.

And yeah, Ben, like you said, like very rational argument that like, okay, this thing is going to be a really interesting niche site for college students and how valuable is that?

Well, Viacom, which owned MTV, thought that that was worth $750 million, which is what they offered to buy the company for in the summer of 2006.

Well, there was another party that really, really wanted to own Facebook at this point in time, and that was Yahoo.

And Yahoo was willing to top Viacom and pay a billion dollars to buy the company.

So here we are, a billion dollar offer on the table and growth is slowing.

Exactly, exactly.

Exactly.

There''s this existential question Mark about the company.

Growth has slowed a lot.

You''ve got a billion dollars on the table, which is a lot of money, especially in those days.

It was shocking six years later when Facebook bought Instagram for a billion dollars.

This would have made the careers of everybody involved.

And Mark of course controls the company, controls the board, thanks to Sean Parker.

He doesn''t have to sell.

But the whole management team is like, yeah, we should probably simple.

And I think the board, you know, it''s hard to know.

They obviously know they can''t force him to sell.

But I suspect if you had asked all of their opinions and certainly Mark did, they probably would have been like, you know, it''s been a great run.

We should probably hit this bid.

So Mark actually agrees to the Yahoo deal.

Billion dollars is going to be all in stock.

Yahoo''s going to buy the company in the interim between when they shake hands on the deal.

And while the docs are being drafted, Yahoo announces their quarterly earnings and they have a bad quarter and the stock drops 20% and Terry Semmel, who was the CEO of Yahoo at the time, said, okay, the deal is, you know, for the same amount of stock.

So commensurately, the deal is now worth $800 million, not a billion dollars.

And that was history turning on a knife point.

And that was all Mark needed to say, you know what?

Thanks, but no thanks.

And this part of the story never gets told, the fact that actually, at first, Mark did not turn down the billion dollar offer from Yahoo.

Mark actually accepted, or at least said, let me turn over another card and get one inch closer to the negotiation being final.

You know, it wasn''t an outright rejection at first.

It was, yeah, come back with the papers.

Yep.

Totally.

That is not the way it gets talked about today.

But I think actually makes the story really kind of even more powerful.

It almost really did slip away.

Well, it''s certainly much more realistic.

It''s a simple and powerful story to say they just outright rejected it.

But that''s just never how these things go.

It''s like, uh, show me your real.

Yep.

Okay.

So analyzing, let''s say he just did turn it down outright.

Well, here''s a reasonable way to look at it.

If what you want to do is run a great company for the rest of your life, it actually was totally rational.

Mark has said publicly, I mean, it''s like 15, 18 years ago, I didn''t have any more ideas as good as Facebook.

But that''s like way undersell again.

There aren''t better companies to start.

Right.

Yes, it would have been nice to have certainty on a billion dollars or whatever percent of the billion mark owned at that point.

And also, a year before my space had gotten bought for $580 million.

Right, by news court.

So it''s like, geez, okay, twice as much as my space.

But rationally, if the optimization function is I wanna run the best company I can for a very long time, almost nobody has started a better company sense.

So if you''re looking at the engagement, You''re looking at the potential, the rational thing actually is just keep running this company because I''ll never discover something like it again.

Yep.

I completely agree with you and Mark has said so much in so many words to you and me personally that he''s not optimizing for financial outcome here.

He''s optimizing for impact.

And I think he likes running this company.

He would want to go start a similar company if he didn''t have this one.

Yes.

Yes, totally.

Also though, to a skill as a strategist, even at this very young age, yes, Ben, you and I just made a compelling argument about why you could have believed Facebook was going to top out with the college market at this point in time.

Mark knew, though, and he had planted the seeds that both newsfeed and open registration were going to be coming later that year.

And he was definitely making that calculus here, too.

I''m like, well, I don''t know what the probability necessarily is that there''s going to hit, but Mark had to believe like, A, if they do, they''re going to be really big.

And B, I think the probability is higher than the people around me think it is.

Yep, that''s totally fair.

Even if you weren''t going to bet on the growth, the user engagement was still currently great and you had a lot of reason to believe that it was going to get even greater.

And you compare all the metrics with friendster in MySpace as time went on got worse.

People churned, they''re daily active to monthly active, would just go down over time.

The page load times would take forever, especially with, well, actually with both, Friendster just was not architected properly.

It was a software engineering computer science issue.

MySpace was this weird thing that was sort of born out of this combined media conglomerate and they just never really had excellent tech architectural talent.

And so, as you sort of looked at not the high level metrics of how many users have ever signed up, because my space and friends are, I think, we''re still way ahead at this point.

If you looked at like, hmm, but how is this going to play out if it sort of keeps compounding?

And you looked at the deeper metrics, you kind of thought, oh, I''m running the better company by a lot.

Once especially, you know, we got to figure out the business, but I am running the better product by a lot.

Yep.

So, okay, to figuring out the business coming out of this episode with Yahoo.

They say no.

The whole management team churns.

The whole management team basically churns over the next set of months.

Mark gets religion on a couple of things.

And actually we should say not Dustin, but a lot of the people around the table who were expecting a nice cash payout and now aren''t getting one or are not pleased.

Yep.

Totally.

So what are they going to do?

The first thing is I think Mark had always operated the company this way, but now he gets real religion of like, we need to get more revenue and we need to focus on becoming truly cash flow positives so that we are never in a position again where we would even consider doing something like this.

So in August of 2006, they do the first partnership with Microsoft.

It''s funny that you know, the Microsoft Facebook relationship in some ways is sort of a precursor to the Microsoft soft open AI relationship today and how that gets built.

Here''s what it is.

Microsoft says, we''re going to take over selling all of the display ad inventory domestically within the US for Facebook.

And we will give you a guaranteed CPM that we can sell.

And then we are going to use this to help bootstrap our online services division, which, as we talked about in our Microsoft series, becomes super, super important, not only for their efforts launching Bing and making that into ultimately a successful business, but even more importantly for Azure that comes out of it.

Microsoft knows they need some scale to bootstrap up and get started with both the ad business but also just like the online services division period.

This is a ton of inventory.

You just think about the amount of page views that are happening here.

Suddenly, Microsoft''s problem is not how do we find enough inventory to sell?

Well, it''s how do we go find enough advertisers to actually fill all these slots on Facebook?

Yes.

And Microsoft have been trying to do this.

They tried to do this with MySpace a little bit earlier and they lost that deal to Google.

So they really need Facebook.

And on the other hand, this is a great deal for Facebook because Facebook sucks at selling ads and Facebook has no targeting or anything.

So they really shouldn''t justify high CPMs at this point.

Yeah.

Outsource it to a good third party network.

Right.

So this is like basically all of Facebook''s revenue for the next couple of years here.

So Facebook had made $9 million in revenue in 2005 when they were selling themselves.

This is Ben as you are saying like, hey, they''re starting to turn on ads in 2005.

It''s starting to work like $9 million.

That''s amazing for year two as a company.

Got to cash flow positive.

Got to cash flow positive.

In 2006, with this Microsoft partnership, that jumps to $48 million in revenue.

Oh, that''s where the money''s pick it is.

Now we''re talking.

And then the next year in 2007, again, I think almost all of this is Microsoft that goes to $153 million in revenue.

So like, okay, we are way out of any league where we could sit or selling ourselves here if we can control our own destiny.

Isn''t it wild thinking about you thought it was crazy to turn down a billion dollar offer or many people thought you were crazy and then just two years later that is only a six X revenue multiple and you''re tripling your over year.

Oh, and by the way, in the second iteration of this Microsoft partnership, which we will talk about in just a minute, it included an investment from Microsoft at a $15 billion valuation.

Oh, hold your horses.

Let''s finish this great 2006, 2007 arc, and then we''ll get there.

Yes.

Point being though, Mark made the right decision for all shareholders of Facebook to walk away from the Yahoo deal.

I mean, it''s at an all-time high.

And walking away from every deal ever he''s made the right decision.

Yes.

But like within a year, he made the right decision.

Yes.

Oh yeah, that''s true.

This became obviously a right fast.

Very fast, very fast.

So how does this happen?

Okay, Adam D''Angelo finally graduates from Caltech joins Facebook full-time as CTO.

I love that Adams are like second protagonist here.

I don''t know.

I don''t know if you did that intentionally, but yeah.

Well, he was right there.

I mean, they were at Exeter together.

Like, I don''t think you can separate it out.

Yeah.

And, you know, I think here, part of the reason why Adam keeps coming into the story is he is a really, really great technologist.

And even though So he''s young, same age as Mark, when he now arrives full time as CTO, this is when Facebook starts to be taking the steps to be building like real technology infrastructure.

So before Adam joins full time, the team was shipping new code to the website, like at a high velocity relative to everybody else out there, you know, it was weekly ish, maybe every couple days, you know, maybe even up to daily, like, well, they were a web company For the first time in history, you actually could.

All these companies with big client and Microsoft would ship every three years with a service pack once a year.

It''s a whole new era where all you have to do is, you know, upload some new PHP code to the FTP server and then boom, the application behaves differently.

The next time someone pulls down the page, it''s the new technology era of interpreted language is running on web servers in a browser.

Now that products are in browsers, meant you could architect your company differently and ship differently.

Yes, and when Adam becomes officially a CTO, it''s like, actually, we should probably just ship multiple times a day.

We should just be shipping all the time.

And also, we should probably start recruiting like a real top tier engineering team.

Because remember, it''s still kind of nuclear winter for startups.

Great tech talent is available.

So they start going and recruiting like really, really top tier engineering hires and it''s a pretty compelling offer like a we''ve got real revenue from this Microsoft partnership where the best funded start up in the valley.

People want to buy us for a billion dollars we turn them down.

That''s all sort of the financial reasons to take it.

For a lot of people too it was like such a breath of fresh air.

I think Facebook was potentially maybe the first company first startup to have an open office plan, like just everything about how they ran the company was different.

It was the prototypical startup.

I mean, to this day, early Facebook is still what most startup culture is aspiring to be.

I think often without knowing it, I mean, everything from the sort of posters on the walls with your mantras and your values to almost having like an employment brand that you really care about cultivating to the idea of like we''re having just as much fun together socially as we are working together.

I think the modern startup culture, especially when you factor in the shipping every day open office, why comedy or kind of trains companies to become like Facebook was a hundred percent.

I mean there was Google out there which had a lot of this element, but it was a very different thing.

It was very academic, very wonky.

These guys were hackers and they shipped, you know, and they were all in it together.

The other thing that was basically true is they were not really interested in recruiting industry veterans, especially on the technical side.

And Mark says this in early talks that he was just prioritizing raw intelligence over experience.

So one of those super intelligent, super talented young engineers with a high slope who joined And back in Fallout 5 was an engineer named Chris Cox, who joined from the Stanford AI Lab.

And Chris joins a team of other young smart engineers, led by Ruchi Sangvi and Andrew Bosworth, working on Mark''s personalized newspaper product idea.

Ruchi was one of Facebook''s very first engineers, and along with her husband, a D.T. the Argerwall, they run South Park Commons now.

Boss was two years ahead of Mark at Harvard and had actually been Mark''s TA in the intro to artificial intelligence CS class that he took, and then he later joined the company.

Which is actually not how he ended up getting a job, but they did happen to cross paths that way before.

Yes, Boss went to Microsoft, I think, before joining Facebook.

Yep, just for a few years.

So the three of them start working on newsfeed.

And so we''ve talked about things like photos and the fundamental architecture of the site.

Newsfeed required like a whole new level of engineering prowess to get this thing to work.

Like you''re not just going to code this up in PHP.

Like photos also required real engineering.

But newsfeed was like pushing the state of the art of what was possible in technology and on the internet.

So the first question you have to ask yourself, if you''re a good product designer, developer, capital allocator, someone in Mark''s shoes saying, should we do this, is, do people want this?

If we build this, will it be valuable?

The reason they knew it would be valuable is because the company is data obsessed and they watch the analytics like a hawk to figure out what are people doing on our site.

And they notice this behavior where people were browsing to other people''s profiles cells just to look at them and see if anything changed.

The user was doing the heavy compute lifting rather than having a personalized newspaper of just bouncing around to a bunch of people''s profiles and saying, anything new here.

So there was an engineer who did something really kind of hacky because they didn''t want to at first put all the engineering resources into building out something like newsfeed, which is, well, when something changes for some period of time, we''ll just highlight it in yellow.

Yes.

So it''s easy for you as you''re bouncing around a different profiles to just see, oh, hey, this thing changed and That totally worked.

They watched the lift and that and they''re like, well, it''s a good feature people like that So that sort of gave them the confidence of we should find a way to make it more obvious to you when new updates happen when things change Technically, David for people who aren''t in the sort of tech ecosystem Why is it so difficult to build something like a newsfeed because now we''re all trained to believe that like a feed is You know, a primitive that is available to you as a developer when you''re building a product because feeds are everywhere.

Feeds are the core feature of most products when you hit the homepage at some sort of feed.

That was not true at the time.

That was not true in any product.

I actually challenge you right now.

Think back to 2005, what was a feed on the web?

What was sort of an infinite scrolling?

They didn''t exist.

This was the first one.

This was the invention of the feed.

Like maybe you''ve got Reddit and Dig and you could sort of make an argument that their feeds their paginated rankings of stories.

So you could see like, oh, what are the most important stories?

But even that''s a pretty different fundamental thing.

I don''t think Reddit had launched yet.

Dig may be exist, but yes, as you said.

Oh, yeah.

Reddit was in the first YC batch, which was 05, so it wasn''t really, it was right around this same time.

Okay.

So how do you make a feed?

Well, if you are an algorithms developer, the way you would sort of think of it is, okay, well, first, I need to pick a point in time, and from that point in time, and let''s call that maybe the last time someone looked at their feed, I need to store that timestamp, and now I need to go look at every single profile of someone that you are connected to, so this is n and download or cache all of their recent updates since that time period.

So I need to like store that somewhere.

I need a new place to store a copy of all of this information that lives on someone''s profile or at least pointers to that on everybody''s profile.

And I need that to happen for every user.

So now it''s n squared.

Every single person on the entire Facebook needs to have something running in the background that is looking at every other person on Facebook since a particular time.

And then that compute and storage all needs to happen fast enough such that by the time they want to go check the feed again, it''s happened again.

And obviously like now that happens in real time.

And I think it was something like every three hours.

There was like a new batch.

Yeah.

It was four times a day when it initially launched.

There was like a four-ex a day refreshment.

Okay.

So every six hours.

Yeah.

It was a cron job because they didn''t have enough memory to run it in real time.

That''s right.

They needed to happen on separate boxes to run this process, cash the results, and then when you loaded your newsfeed, go fetch them.

So this is like a whole new application using the same data that the company has to build in order to make newsfeed happen.

And so what you just described is all the technical work just making a feed possible.

On the back end, this doesn''t contemplate any of the front-end design or engineering or incredible permutations of how to display this data when it does come back, given a massive combinatorial problem of how might this data come back?

Exactly.

Then you need to make the feed actually compelling.

Like, I don''t really care about, you know, somebody who I''m tangentially connected to what they had for lunch today, but I really care about like a photo of Ben at the acquired meetup.

Right.

So now you''re telling me you want to rank order it by something other than...

Chronology.

Make another pass and figure out what I think is going to be the most interesting to you, which on its own is an incredibly difficult computer science problem.

What is interesting to you?

What data should we use to inform that decision?

Right.

Right.

Totally.

Who are your close friends?

Who do you care about the most?

What general news do you care about the most?

What types of stuff do you care about?

Do we have to put weights on every relationship in this entire complex friend graph between every single entity and how close they are and then re-rank that very often?

Eventually, yeah.

Yes.

So the team spends the better part of 2006 working on this by September it''s ready.

And so by September 5th, 2006, just in time for the new school year, they launch it.

And people noticed because they launch it like to everybody right away.

And this is a massive paradigm shift.

Yeah, it''s not opt in or anything.

This is Facebook changing the game of social.

Not opt in.

Everybody gets it right away.

They get 30,000 angry emails to support on the first day from users who are really upset about this.

10% of the entire global user base signs up for a group, a Facebook group called students against Facebook newsfeed.

I''m pretty sure I was part of this group.

The irony here is they had only just launched open groups across school networks days or weeks before.

So like they enable the tool of their own vitriol here.

And also guess how people are finding out about this group through news feed.

Yes.

This is the great irony of the whole situation.

There''s a literal panic in the streets.

There are people protesting outside the office.

There is somebody trying to use a crane to get into the third story, basically a TV truck is trying to cover what''s happening in the pandemonium.

And at the same time, despite everyone telling them, I hate this thing, it''s the worst thing ever.

If you look at the analytics, people love it.

People cannot get enough of scrolling through the new news feed.

And the reason they''re really upset is actually quite interesting.

They''re saying, oh, it''s sharing this with my whole network.

work.

Okay, but you updated it on your profile, which has always been public to your whole network.

And I think Facebook, for the first time, kind of stepped in it and realized, oh, even though technically this data has always, you know, we didn''t change how public or private it is.

It''s just as accessible.

People react really strongly when you change the ease of obtaining that information or whether it feels like you are pushing that information out versus someone is sort of pulling by going to your profile and viewing.

It went from pull to push.

Yes.

So it''s the start of the new school year.

We''ve just come off this sort of tumultuous summer.

Growth had slowed, walked away from the Yahoo deal.

There''s this revolt in the streets against newsfeed, which to mark''s mind, along with open and Reg, which was supposed to come like two days later of opening up Facebook to anybody.

They delayed that because of the newsfeed reaction.

But to Mark''s mind, the two of these things are like the big growth levers to reignite growth for Facebook.

The board, the management team, everybody''s like, all right, we got a roll newsfeedback.

People hate it.

This is PR 101.

We apologize.

We roll it back.

And to add a kicker, newsfeed actually significantly hurt Facebook''s revenue.

Because where do you think all the page views we''re coming from and all the refreshes?

Oh, loading a new ad.

Yep, loading all the profile views and clicking around.

So page views are actually going to go down in this new paradigm.

Every reason is aligned to roll this back.

So Ruchi and Chris and Bos though are looking at all the data and they''re like, totally crap.

Engagement is through the roof.

Yeah, people can''t get enough of this.

People say they hate it, but yeah, it looks like they can''t get enough of it.

So Mark decides that he is going to write a post on Facebook about this.

And it''s titled, calm down, breathe, we hear you.

and he announces that they''re going to launch a set of controls for you to control what of your activities get published to news feed and what don''t.

Which by the way, it sounds like something that Mark would say today.

I think this 2006 era is like the last time and then you would have had like a 17 year break and now we''re sort of getting that mark again.

Yes.

You can''t imagine and Mark circa 2018 saying, calm down, breathe, we hear you.

Yes, so it''s kind of a brilliant strategy of like, hey, I acknowledge that this was surprising.

We didn''t handle the rollout, right?

I''m seeing that you all actually like this in the data.

Let me give you some controls so that what you''re really worried about, you have some control over.

And then let''s just see what happens.

And within two weeks, it''s like magic.

Everybody just gets used to it and that this is now the way Facebook and social media operates and engagement continues to skyrocket.

Yeah.

But it''s funny.

I did just pull up.

We''ve been getting a lot of feedback about newsfeed.

We think they''re great products, but many of you are not immediate fans and have found them overwhelming and cluttered.

I don''t think clutter was what people were complaining about.

A little bit of redirection there.

Yeah.

It''s funny.

We didn''t take away any privacy options.

Your privacy options remain the same.

The privacy rules haven''t changed.

None of your information is visible to anyone who couldn''t see it before the changes, blah, blah, blah.

It''s like it is interesting.

It''s true and not relevant.

That''s not what people are mad about.

People are pretty aware that this is the same information.

Well, and I think to sort of set a theme here that we''re going to come back to several times.

the definition of what social media is is actually very fluid.

And it changes in the consumer''s mind.

I''d even say before this, there wasn''t social media, or at least Facebook wasn''t social media.

Facebook was a social network, but this was the first time they introduced a media component, a thing you would read.

Right.

Inspired by a newspaper.

Right.

And I think when these paradigm shifts happen.

People get upset because their expectations are being violated.

So it actually doesn''t really matter what the privacy is or isn''t.

It''s the expectations.

Right.

I''m glad you planted the seed because this will come back over and over again in their history of people now feel differently and the product needs to change with those societal expectations in order for people to not be upset about it.

Yep.

Unfortunately for the moment, I think the lesson that Mark and the company took from this experience was, well, we actually know what''s best and the user base will just get used to it whenever we make a change.

It just happened to be that that was true with newsfeed, but that wouldn''t always be true.

So originally, the two big initiatives newsfeed and open registration were supposed to basically launch together.

And they chose to do newsfeed first because it was gonna be a little bit easier to roll out and be more valuable to the core college audience that was just starting back for the new semester, the fall semester at school.

So they launched that first.

And then yet the original plan was open registration.

Facebook is now opened to anybody in the world who was gonna come two days later on September 7th.

They obviously put that on the shelf for a long time, two and a half weeks.

At the end of September, open registration launches, is anyone can sign up for Facebook.

This is another major, major change.

Before all these networks were siloed, you had to be part of a verified email address network to join Facebook.

Now anyone can sign up.

This is the beginning of, uh-oh, my mom is on Facebook.

Exactly, exactly, exactly.

Which ultimately would be a problem because that''s what created room for Instagram, for Snapchat, et cetera, et cetera.

But that would actually be down the line.

In a weird sort of perverse way, I think because of all the controversy around newsfeed, when open-reads launched, there wasn''t the same kind of controversy.

People were already desensitized or they had just been through newsfeed and they''re like, all right, yeah, whatever.

Nobody even really noticed that much, especially because the product experience didn''t change for the already engaged users.

years.

And to the extent that you did feel that privacy had changed, you''re now kind of used to anything I put on Facebook gets broadcasted.

So who cares if more randos come in?

It''s already getting broadcasted.

Yep.

Yep.

And now with newsfeed, there is this mechanism that makes sure like, hey, even as randos from your perspective, join Facebook, you''re still seeing the updates of people you care about.

Well, I don''t think at first when And it was this like pure chronology.

Yeah, I guess that''s a good point.

As they make it more algorithmic.

But this was still a period in time where your friends were your friends.

I mean, Facebook was only two years old.

And so for the vast majority of users, they joined in the last year.

So they didn''t have anybody who wasn''t really their friend as a friend.

Now, I just have to treat Facebook posts as if their public because the group of friends is aged.

But in that period of time, you could trust if something was getting published to your friends that like just go on your friends.

Right.

The age of the network itself was only two years.

So your friendships hadn''t shifted that much.

Well, open reds, despite high schools and workplaces not working well, open reds works really well.

Yeah.

I mean, Facebook has a brand at this point.

It''s the best social network.

It''s the fastest growing social network.

It''s the one that all the college kids will always be the cool people in any society at any time.

That''s the age group of trend setting and they have conquered that market.

High school kids want to be like college students and people not in college want to be like college students.

Yep.

So over the summer Facebook was adding like five to 10,000 users a day by late fall after launching open and registration, they''re now adding 70,000 users a day.

Wow, by fall of 06.

Yeah, wow.

Growth really picks up.

So this brings us now to Spring of 07 and the final piece of Mark''s original product roadmap.

I''m bored, aka platform.

And platform is this kind of forgotten thing right now.

I mean, it''s Farmville, it''s Zingha, it''s apps on Facebook.

book.

It''s quizzes.

It''s quizzes, yes.

Welcome back up later.

That''ll come back for a period of about four years from 2007 to 2011.

This is the most important thing in the company.

And this is what everybody believes the core and future of the company is.

Facebook has become a platform.

This is the goal of a technology company.

Become a platform.

Be like Microsoft.

This is now Facebook is like Microsoft.

We are a developer platform.

And there was this incredible tension.

At least it seemed like the tech media wanted to play up this tension.

Are they an advertising company or a platform company?

Because they''re super different business models with very different incentives and users kind of need to know how to think about it.

And it was kind of at the same time Cheryl had just joined the company or was about to join the company the next year in 2008.

So yeah, not yet.

And so they really hadn''t gotten serious.

She sort of led them to figure out, hey, let''s survey all the business models, do some work on each of them and figure out and commit to being an ads company.

At this point in time, like they were showing ads, but the whole leadership team, at least I''m convinced, believed we are on the way to becoming a platform.

a hundred percent.

So May 24th, 2007, Facebook holds its first developer conference to launch their developer platform, F8, which let''s take a step back.

This whole idea is kind of wild.

A developer platform on the web.

The web is a developer platform.

Facebook is now becoming a platform on top of an open developer platform.

But they have two important things that as an application developer, you''re interested in, one, user attention, you know, the same way that Microsoft had user attention with PCs because they had the install base of Windows, and two, a whole crap ton of data about each person that you could then build into your application to make it really rich and feel personalized.

And it turned out that that was really attractive to developers.

So at Effie, They announced that the Facebook user base is now over 20 million and it is growing by over 100,000 users a day.

So growth is accelerating.

Wait, it''s 20 million total and growing by 100,000 a day.

Yes.

I mean, open red had just launched a couple of months before, so like this thing is really taking off.

Oh, my God.

Every 10 days they''re adding another 20th of their user base and they''re growing by five per, what is that?

It''s like 7% every two weeks.

It''s like three and a half percent a week.

Yeah.

Pretty good.

Wow.

At a scale of over 20 million already.

Wow.

It is the sixth highest traffic site in the world and they''re announcing to all the developers in attendance.

The Facebook API, Facebook graph is now open to you.

You can build apps and publish and run them natively on Facebook.

book.

For users and part of Mark''s original product roadmap from 2005, this is huge.

Until this point in time, Facebook was about digitizing everything that happened in your offline life.

Your real friends, your real parties, you went to the real photos you took.

There wasn''t anything detached from your offline reality to do on Facebook.

Now, all of a sudden you can play games on Facebook, you can take quizzes on Facebook, you can use apps on Facebook, and you can do them all with your friends.

It''s pretty compelling.

I remember playing, was it Scrabulous?

Yeah.

I think I was playing with my sister, with my grandma.

I mean, there''s a great way to like do things digitally with the people that matter to you.

Yup.

And I think it''s also an early foreshadowing of the job that mobile and the smartphone would really do in people''s lives, which is, hey, there''s actually like a lot of white space where you''re just bored during your day.

I mean, Mark''s original title of the feature of I''m Board was perfect.

This is the cure for boredom.

It just so happened that it was on a desktop.

And so when you were bored at your desk or bored at your home, mobile then opened that up to like, hey, I''m bored anywhere.

Right.

And it gave Facebook from a business perspective.

It sort of gave them another stakeholder.

Hey, developers are someone who can keep people on the platform longer, so we can show them more ads.

They might do their own advertising, so they might drive traffic to Facebook that they could help grow the core platform itself.

It gives us sort of more lock-in as people develop for us and as users seek out applications on us.

They''re hoping for sort of that Microsoft Playbook of platforms get really epic lock-in.

Yeah.

Oh, and by the way, developers on the platform will probably have their own business models where they''ll make revenue.

And especially if we ultimately introduce our own virtual currency, we can probably make revenue from their revenue too.

Yeah.

So the internal goal of the company was to get 5,000 developers in the first year who would be making social apps on the platform.

I mean, they get, they got 5,000 in two days.

Developers went freaking nuts.

It was a great keynote.

It was a great keynote.

Yes.

You know, they went nuts because yeah, Ben, as you say, like, oh, distribution to a lot of people and then like bringing along your friends and data on them, like that''s very powerful incentive as a developer to then go make an app or a game for the platform.

You''re building a web app that It has an unbelievably rich set of data that you can hook into.

The thing that I was, I don''t think I could have put into words then, but I can now is, has a successful, scale, durable platform ever been built that wasn''t an operating system?

Like, it always felt weird to me in that moment that Facebook thought they could be a platform, because I was like, well, it''s a website.

I mean, it''s a web app.

and I have profile and I have all this rich information, but it''s not like running on my device.

Well, Ben, it turns out you would have been right.

If only I had the words.

But what do you do with that information?

What was I gonna be bearish on the company?

That would have been a super wrong call.

Right, well this is the amazing story that we''re telling here of like they keep surviving and thriving despite not having the operating system.

Yeah, listeners, right in if you can think of one a successful scaled durable platform where the platform is able to make money and they''re able to make a lot of money for developers for people on the platform that is not an operating system that runs on hardware hardware.

either captively controlled hardware like Apple or open hardware like Android and Microsoft.

And this gets into the question of what is a platform because let''s say I make a web app that I run on my own website, I do my own marketing, I do my own monetization, but I let users authenticate Facebook so I can pull some information out of their profile.

It''s like it''s not really built on the Facebook platform.

It''s not like the core APIs that enable my application to run are using Facebook''s APIs. I''m using Facebook''s APIs to grab some data.

The core API set that allows it to run is the browser.

Yeah.

It is almost like, if you think about the intermediation layers, Facebook was trying to build a platform on top of a browser that was a platform on top of an operating system that was a platform in it.

The reason why we aren''t all using rich Facebook apps all the time today and think of it as the default platform, it was just too many layers of abstraction away from the hardware to win.

I think that is totally right.

But for the moment, thousands and thousands of both indie devs and venture back companies like flock to the platform.

But what this does tease out is Facebook and now we can talk about this 15 plus years later has kind of a weak position for launching a platform since they don''t control the OS or the hardware and so they have to make a little bit more of an appealing sale to a developer and that includes big distribution for you.

But it also includes a ton of access to data.

And I remember being an early Facebook developer and after user authenticates looking at that JSON and being like, okay, so it''s their whole profile.

Oh, it''s their whole friends list.

Wow, I get a lot of stuff here.

And Facebook was incentivized to do that because they almost had to sell harder than other platforms who controlled hardware historically would have had to.

Yeah, it''s a super great point.

Now also the reality was at the time, I think developers were getting plenty of value just out of the distribution.

And that was coming from newsfeed.

If a user starts using your Facebook app, and then the activity that they''re doing on your app is getting published to the news feeds of all their friends.

Oh, yeah.

You could build a whole zing on that interaction paradigm.

Oh, yes, you can.

There''s this great quote from Josh Elman in the Stephen Levy book.

Just says, if you''re a developer and you can get someone to bother 10 friends to get one more user to join You''re very happy because you just got one more user Facebook though has nine other people who''ve just gotten bothered And he doesn''t say that and are quite unhappy about that.

And that''s the tradeoff They have to weigh that sort of there in the type of platform.

They are trying to build They have set up that incentive set and they need to figure out what to do with it.

Yep So, for a year or two, that is the state of play, Facebook, brilliantly for them, eventually pulls back on organic newsfeed distribution for apps, says, hey, like, we got to stop this, we got to take care of the problem.

You don''t need to know every time there''s a new mafia war move by so and so showing up in your newsfeed.

And that does effectively kill a large percentage of developers and apps on the platform.

Yep.

But it''s the right long-term move.

That was the right thing to do for Facebook with a 20-year view.

Absolutely.

And it doesn''t kill the platform, though.

It actually makes it even more valuable to Facebook because for the developers and apps who have gotten to scale, they kind of look at this and they say, okay, my organic distribution just got kneecapped.

But Facebook is still this pretty powerful platform.

What if I just buy ads?

How well would that work?

Can I generate positive ROI if I buy ads to effectively accomplish the same thing, natively on the platform and drive usage back to my app?

Turns out that there was a very profitable arbitrage there still for many years to come.

And for Facebook, they''re like, well, hell yeah.

Okay, we''re monetizing the platform through user engagement and ads that we''re showing on the right rail while people are using Facebook apps.

We are also monetizing through currency and commerce that is happening in the apps where we''re taking a cut of that through payments.

Now we''re gonna monetize platform in a third way, which is the biggest scale developers and app distributors on the platform are going to use our native advertising as their primary form of distribution.

I mean, you can see why for a couple of years here, Facebook is like, well, this is it.

We''ve won, you know, we are a platform, this is it.

Yep.

And then mobile comes along.

Oh, mobile.

That is quite the chapter in the Facebook story.

but before we do that, now is a great time to tell you about one of our favorite companies, the Climate Aligned AI Infrastructure Company, Crusoe.

Yes, Crusoe is a vertically integrated cloud platform built specifically for AI workloads that was recently named the gold standard of AI cloud providers by Dylan Patel over at semi-analysis.

And something that''s new and really cool since we started working with Crusoe last year, they''ve opened up the raw metal in their data centers to customers.

So let''s say you''re a large enterprise who wants to run your own infrastructure and not use a cloud layer, you could actually now do that with Crusoe directly as a data center customer, which several of the largest companies in the world are now doing.

Yep, they''ve totally reimagined traditional data center architecture to support the huge power cooling and compute density needs of AI.

Yep, that''s important because power demand in GPUs is increasing dramatically, which means the traditional data center design and engineering of the hyperscalers is no longer optimal.

So Crusoe''s infrastructure built from the ground up for GPUs with elements like high density racks, direct liquid to chip cooling, that enables them to support the most demanding AI workloads that traditional data centers just can''t handle.

And at the same time, as GPU cluster sizes continue to increase, there''s an ever increasing demand for energy.

Crusoe has 15 gigawatts in its development pipeline, which is an astronomical amount of power.

Their Abilene Texas facility alone has over 1.2 gigawatts planned, which will make it one of the largest clusters in the world.

Yep, and it''s also not just about the amount of capacity in the pipeline, it''s about how fast it can come online.

Crusoe''s team has decades of experience constructing and operating data centers, which enables them to bring these new data centers online super fast.

First, as many of you already know, Crusoe sources the energy for these data centers in the most efficient and climate aligned way in the entire industry, through clean, low-cost and abundant energy that otherwise goes to waste.

For example, in oil fields where natural gas is flared, in congested parts of the grid where renewable power is curtailed, or other areas where energy is stranded.

Which actually accomplishing that is a crazy hard thing.

Crusoe''s energy first approach means they can build data centers in some of the most challenging locations on Earth, bringing computing to the energy rather than the other way around.

Yep.

The net of all of this is that Crusoe can provide nuclear levels of power for far less cost than other providers and with low or in some cases actually negative emissions.

And that''s super important because the biggest bottleneck to AI progress is actually energy.

It''s not compute.

Yeah.

Anyway, they''re just a great company.

We''re super proud to work with them and to be investors.

To learn more about Crucio, you can go to crucio.ai slash acquired.

That''s CRUSOE.ai slash acquired.

Or click the link in the show notes and just tell them that Ben and David sent you.

Thanks, Crucio.

All right, so David, we''re here in the era of mobile, right?

This is January 2007, Steve Jobs just announced the iPhone.

The whole world changed, right?

Well, actually ironically, no, or at least not for quite a while.

Yes, January 2007, Steve Jobs announces the iPhone.

People forget though, it took five years for mobile and smartphone adoption to really ramp up and like actually changed the world.

There was no SDK in that first iPhone in iOS that didn''t come till 2008.

It was $700.

Android was a Blackberry clone at the time, not an iPhone clone.

and the droid does campaign wouldn''t be another year or two.

Yeah, I think two years.

I think that was 2009, if I remember right.

Yeah.

So yeah, I mean, hell, Facebook platform didn''t even launch until May 2007, so after the iPhone announcement.

Yep.

So for the moment, platform is rockin'' and rollin''.

Like we were just talking about, Facebook is becoming the next Microsoft, which brings us to the second Microsoft partnership in October of 2007.

So just five months after F8 and platform launch, Facebook now has like all of the leverage.

Dan Rose has some great stories on Twitter about how this negotiation goes down.

Oh yeah, you spent time with Dan, didn''t you prepping for this?

Yep, and I chatted with Dan about this.

This is great.

So Microsoft, perhaps obvious now in retrospect to everybody, really just wants to buy the company, but Mark''s of course not going to do that after the whole Yahoo experience, etc.

Microsoft is also happy, though, to just keep the partnership going and expand it.

Because one, it is really helping them spin up their online services division and get really good at online ad sales and ad serving.

And two, they know they made a huge error in missing search and letting Google get big.

And social sure seems like it''s going to be the next search size platform.

So they''re happy to just be in bed with Facebook in a way that they never will be with Google.

As long as they can keep it going, I mean, for them, I think the thing that shocked them about Google is, oh my God, the business model of the web is advertising.

Search and browsers and everything are monetized by advertising and that''s completely orthogonal to our traditional license-based business model.

Social sure looks like where all the page views are going and is going to monetize exactly the same way as search.

So actually the thing that''s important to them is locking in those page views to the extent that they can participate in this market.

It kind of has to be either we own you or we are the long-term ad provider, which they didn''t end up being or were a big equity holder.

Yeah, so enter this second partnership negotiation.

October 2007, Microsoft comes down to Palo Alto.

Facebook tells them that hey, Google is actually really interested in taking this partnership over.

Larry and Sergei have been banging down the door and we''ve been trying to hold them off, but they''re coming to meet with us tomorrow to talk about switching our Facebook ad serving partnership over to Google.

And this has been great.

We love working with y''all.

You are our preference, our preferred partner.

We want to keep it going with you, but we need to get the deal done ten night.

So they lock themselves all in the conference room.

They start negotiating.

It''s getting late, 10 o''clock goes by 11 o''clock.

The Microsoft team, you know, by Facebook standards is all old guys, like they''re getting tired.

And then, you know, old guys, like, you know, 40.

Like, oh, it''s so old.

And then at midnight, this is amazing.

You can''t make this up.

Facebook probably planned this.

All of a sudden, this really loud, like house music starts blaring, like with like heavy bass in the office.

And the office is hopping, like everybody''s there, the whole company''s there, it''s midnight.

The Microsoft guys, like, what''s going on?

And the Facebook, you know, it''s like, oh yeah.

We have a hackathon schedule tonight.

And actually, Javier Olivan had just started at Facebook, who''s now COO.

Who is now the COO of meta had just started at Facebook as an engineer.

And he had organized this hackathon to begin work on internationalizing the site.

So tonight is the beginning of internationalization, which is a critical, critical part of Facebook''s next chapter of growth.

Yes.

And it is beginning at the same time that this Microsoft partnership is happening in a conference room.

And didn''t this Microsoft deal will end up being about international?

Yes.

Yes it did.

So they keep going at one point during the night, one of the Microsoft guys, according to Dan, Lixit Hinton says, wow, this is awesome.

This is just like the old days of Microsoft.

So they finished the negotiation at 6am.

They announced the new partnership that very same day as promised with the threat of Google.

Microsoft becomes the worldwide exclusive third-party advertising network for all display ads on Facebook.

So it was domestic in the US before.

Now it''s international to and domestic everywhere around the world.

Facebook, of course, can still also sell their own inventory themselves, but anything that they don''t want to sell themselves or that is excess inventory, Microsoft gets exclusive access to be the only ad network where you can access it.

And the big kicker, Microsoft is going to invest $240 million in Facebook at a $15 billion valuation.

This is like 13 or 14 months after the failed Yahoo deal for $1 billion.

That is the thing that no one talks about here.

I''m so glad you brought this up because before they started this negotiation, the attempt was to buy Facebook.

The highest offer floated.

We talked about this in the Microsoft episode.

It was a complicated set of yield terms that basically netted out to a $24 billion offer.

And that was less than two years after the $1 billion offer that everyone talks about with Yahoo.

Oh, remember the time where Mark Zuckerberg turned down a billion dollars?

Less than two years later, he turned down 24 billion and that they were really good for the money.

It''s Microsoft.

But turned it around into an investment at 15 billion.

Yeah, it''s crazy.

So, the great thing is like all great partnerships, everyone makes out wonderfully here.

Except maybe the venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, because this just like breaks everyone''s brain.

It was the high watermark for Facebook''s valuation for a while, because the great financial crisis would happen after those valuations would all reset, and then Facebook''s next deal would get done.

I think with Yuri Milner at 10 billion?

10 billion dollar valuation with Yuri.

Yep.

And Yuri would actually also buy common stock through a secondary tender offer in that.

So his dollar cost average would get down to more like six.

So he got a scream and deal.

But for the moment, there are no comps to this ever.

Dotcom bubble, you name it, like never has been a comp like this for an investment in a private technology startup.

The closest comp that I can even sort of think of was Google''s market cap at IPO was 23 billion.

So like higher, but not that much higher.

And Google at IPO was a $2 billion revenue run rate spitting off hundreds of millions of dollars in free cash flow annually.

Facebook at this point in time is basically break even and doing 150 million in revenue, most of which is Microsoft itself.

All that said, Microsoft, Microsoft, this is a home-freaking run, like we''ve been saying all along, helps them spin up Bing, doing all the ad-serving for this, getting in like real online services, and then being, Microsoft is not a hedge fund, as we talked about on that episode, but that $240 million investment.

By the time they start selling it down, years after Facebook is public, ends up being worth $8 billion.

dollars.

Wow.

And then maybe the most important benefit to Microsoft out of all of this is like Microsoft and Facebook have always had a good relationship.

Unlike Microsoft has with Google and Apple.

I remember Facebook events like when you look at the page, it was a Bing map, not a Google map that always like felt emblematic of the partnership to me.

Yeah.

Every single place it could be a Microsoft product it was.

Yes, and it wasn''t a Google product.

Yep.

Okay, so interestingly, here we are 2007, Facebook is still saying we don''t need to be in control of the core revenue creator for us.

Like we think platform is the future, Microsoft, you''re our preferred partner to handle making the money.

Yes, and I think, you know, there''s two things here.

Yes, I think that is true specifically at this moment in time, but this is where, you know, kind of like calling it all the way back to civilization and the Forex strategy game.

He''s got multiple bets he''s placing on the chessboard.

One, as you said, is like platform.

Like, hey, platform is rocking and rolling.

We think we''re building the next great technology company and the next great business model just on platform.

Also, yeah, we''re a social media company that involves a lot of page views and engagement and like the right way to monetize that is advertising.

So yes, we''ve just continued this big Microsoft partnership.

But we have the right to sell our own inventory and we should probably start building that muscle too.

The other thing that''s happening here is Mark still kind of thought ads were gross at this point in history.

So the things he cared about were product and engineering and design and he kind of wanted to outsource everything else or at least have someone else at the company think about it.

And having Microsoft take care of the ads was I think in his mind kind of a win-win.

That way the commodity stuff can happen elsewhere and I can focus on the thing that really matters.

And the company really did not have the insight yet.

Oh, we can do ads different and better than anyone has ever done them before.

Well, I''m smiling as you''re saying that because in practice for this moment, yeah.

In reality, they were trying to build their own native Facebook advertising unit, so to speak.

It was just beacon.

Yeah, beacon is one of the most epic failures in Facebook''s whole history.

Yeah.

Okay, so beacon.

Well, first off, you were totally right, and I think you were foreshadowing Sheryl Sandberg there of like Mark wants somebody within the company to just, you know, run and manage this thing and build it, great world class.

Before Sheryl, do you know which Facebook executive led Beacon?

I do not.

Jamoth Polly Hoppattia.

No way.

He always talks about the growth he I never knew he was in charge of Beacon first.

This was Jamoth''s big thing before growth.

And actually the epic failure here of beacon leads directly to growth as we shall see in a second.

Now, what was beacon?

So like he said, Mark is kind of allergic to traditional advertising.

But he''s like, well, we have this incredible social activity happening on Facebook.

And we know through newsfeed that people engage with and they love it.

What if they were a way for a native ad baked into the very fabric of the product itself that brands could sort of control and monetize.

Well, if we gave brands a way to essentially boost how people are already engaging with them, that might be the way to do this.

And what this ends up being in practice is brands publishing your friend''s e-commerce activity into your newsfeed.

Now, to be fair to Mark and Jamath and the company, we didn''t know yet what the right advertising unit on Facebook was gonna be.

And this is probably as good an idea as any because like the core thing that you do on Facebook is you engage with your friends and you engage with their stories on newsfeed.

And there''s kind of no evidence really that people would want to do anything else but that.

And so you''re trying to kind of think of like, how do we shoehorn advertising in brands into this?

I actually, I don''t buy it at all.

The obvious thing is show an image that people can click on and take them to a website.

It''s display ads and like, I don''t understand why they needed to try to way overthink it and say our ad format has to be something that no one''s ever thought of before.

Like just offer advertisers to do the thing that they know how to buy.

Well, I was trying to like think of how to be the most charitable possible to the company and how they can come up with it.

But yeah, I have next in my notes here to be clear.

This was a truly, truly terrible head up your rear end idea.

These are actually two different things I think.

There was Beacon, which was JavaScript that an advertiser could embed on their website, on an e-commerce provider''s website, that would do exactly what you''re talking about.

Publish into the newsfeed purchases that people were making.

And like, this was at the point where you wanted to publish all sorts of interesting different things on social media.

I don''t think we knew for sure that purchases wasn''t gonna be one of them.

Like people still keep their Venmo history public.

You don''t know what people are gonna do.

The second thing that I think is in your description there a little bit is the idea of social ads that brands could take interactions that happen on pages and boost them, but they couldn''t just take out a regular old ad.

So it was this weird thing where like you could only advertise as a brand to people where someone in their network had interacted with your brand page.

Yeah.

Pretty convoluted.

I get that it''s like this super natively social thing.

But again, it did feel like they started in this place where they''re like, let''s get way too clever for our own good first and then work backward to the most basic ad unit.

Yeah.

Totally agree.

That said, like as soon as it''s live, it becomes clear, like one nobody wants this, either of these things.

Yeah.

Users don''t want it.

Users are confused why they''re seeing.

I mean, certainly there''s instant blowback against their publishing my purchases.

Someone I think had an engagement spoiled by a diamond ring getting broadcast.

Yes.

Oh, yeah.

I was going to say, I mean, this is number two.

Like, the privacy implications here actually are like horrific, like, spoiling engagements.

Like, that''s the wholesome, horrific privacy things.

Like, you can imagine the non-wholesome publishing stuff that you''re buying versions of this.

Yep.

And then, of course, advertisers are confused and people don''t really understand what''s an ad, what''s not an ad.

They just burned credibility everywhere by launching both of these things.

Yep, totally.

And Mark and the company is coming off the newsfeed experience where they''re like, yeah, if we just give it enough time, users will get used to it.

So they let it run for a couple weeks.

They run the newsfeed playbook of like, yeah, yeah, we hear you, but you''ll get used to it.

and here''s some more controls.

Oh, the social ads was years and years, but the purchase is you''re right.

That was just, I think, a couple of weeks.

Yeah, for Beacon.

Ultimately, after a few weeks, they do acquiesce and they say, okay, we will turn Beacon off, we''ll make it opt in as opposed to opt out.

And you can have a way to completely turn off all Beacon tracking permanently from your profile.

A lot of people do that.

Beacon activity basically drops to zero and then, yeah, two years later, it''s like completely killed off.

And this sets the stage for Cheryl joining the company, because I think, you know, Mark''s take away from this is like, okay, maybe I don''t understand dedo advertising as well as I thought I did.

Like I thought I didn''t like it, but I thought I could be clever and engineer this new thing and like, actually let''s bring in somebody who like really, really does understand this.

And Cheryl was the perfect person coming from Google, Cheryl joined Google in 2001, right as they were figuring out ad words.

I mean, that''s like three years after the company was founded.

Totally.

And the company didn''t figure out ad words for a couple of years.

So it was like, that was like the key moment.

And then Cheryl built and ran the whole self-serve business at Google, which was the most important and the most technology like enabled part of what they were doing.

She had built the greatest digital advertising system in the world, and Mark was like, oh, I''m trying to build the greatest digital advertising system in the world.

Who could I ever get to do that with me?

And wouldn''t it be great if that person was also a good manager and leader who could teach me how to manage and lead?

Yes.

Yes.

And I think that really is the quote unquote deal they make.

And they say, and you know, Cheryl agrees too.

So it''s not like, hey, Mark said like, you''re gonna take this side of the company and I''m gonna take that side of the company.

She always reported to him like the whole company was his company, but Mark is really focused on product, engineering, and importantly, platform.

Cheryl takes ads, Cheryl takes operations, et cetera.

And when she comes on board, like you referenced this earlier, Ben, there''s basically no ad targeting that''s happening natively on Facebook.

They''re probably is targeting that''s happening through the third party Microsoft advertising network.

But none of that is like technology that Facebook''s building or value that''s accruing to Facebook.

And so the first thing Mark and Cheryl did when she joined was like, OK, beacon was such a disaster.

We''ve got this great partnership with Microsoft.

Like let''s just do a full exploration.

Should we be in the ads business at all?

Yeah, she definitely famously kind of led the exploration of what business are we actually in here?

Yeah.

And, you know, ultimately, they decide, yes, we are in a media business, thus we should be in the advertising business, and we should do it right, and we should make it work.

And, ultimately, that is going to be building a really, really, really great targeting engine, which is the thing that Facebook is, like, uniquely capable of doing.

Yeah.

So, though, back to here where we are in 2008 to seemingly unrelated, but about to get very related things are going on.

One, after the beacon fiasco when Cheryl joined, Chamoth kind of needs a new job at the company.

Like total credit to Mark, to Cheryl, to Facebook as a company.

I think at most places, like, Chamoth would have been fired immediately for what happened with beacon.

But the culture at Facebook is like, nope, we move fast, we break things and we''re always on offense and this didn''t work and let''s find the right thing for you to do and thank goodness because that brings us to number two right around this time once again user growth slows at Facebook.

Yeah, so it''s funny that I don''t feel like in the public eye we really knew these things, but as you kind of dig into the company history, you''re like, oh, there are these moments in time growth really did stall out.

And, you know, Chamoth has said on stage since then, oh, I totally thought that growth was done.

And there''s a few things to note about the growth team.

One is, it was effectively the first growth team.

Yes.

I think it was the first growth team.

Yeah.

Everyone who wants to get into growth now, I don''t think really fully grasps.

That is a brand new discipline invented in 2008.

And the way they sort of defined it at Facebook was, There''s marketing, there''s product, but marketing and product both touch customers in different ways and so the left hand needs to talk to the right hand.

So for example, you should not have a marketing team that is sending out emails through an email marketing system and a product team that is sending out notifications to users through the product with no notion of how they''re speaking to each other.

where you should A, unify those efforts through one team, and B, that team should live within product, or at least that team should be tightly coupled to product with the general belief or reason for being that your product is the best lever to grow.

No amount of marketing you could ever throw at something that is not integrated into your product will be as effective as your product doing a good job with features, hitting the right users with the right message and the right value at the right time in a native way to the core feature set of the product.

And so you''ve got Shamath, you''ve got Alex Schultz, you''ve got Naomi Glyte and Javier Olivan.

And so you''ve got this core early team.

It''s four people and then it expands to kind of six or seven folks that are formed really on this agreement between Shamath and Mark of, we''re going to have this dedicated growth team and our mission is going to be to grow Facebook using Facebook itself, not through extrinsic measures.

Yep.

And this was like an incredible insight and was so perfect for Facebook because I think this growth insight of growth through product can apply to any company, but it especially applies to a virally growing social network like Facebook.

Yes.

There''s interesting things that make it tick.

The first of which is this has to be the most data-obsessed team in the company.

Every team should be data-obsessed, but like the growth team is really the one who sort of discovers, oh, here are the obvious places where users are or deriving value, here are the obvious places where users are getting confused, here are the obvious opportunities to find new users, here are the obvious opportunities to reduce friction, analytics is the answer for that.

And I think that there''s a lot of really interesting stories especially around internationalization of the growth team and partnering with other product teams around the company to say, what is an engineering and product approach to something that traditionally has been done other ways?

Like, the way most people would translate their product is by hiring translation, servicing firms or by hiring a dedicated person to go through string by string and edit, well, we''re Facebook.

We have all these users.

What if we just, you know, when we''re launching in Spain, surface different words to Spanish speakers and say, okay, is this the right word for Spanish or not?

Hey, can you translate this and crowdsource it and double check it with everyone?

And that way, you can not just translate five or 10 of the top languages in the world.

You can be in every language all the time up to date using Facebook itself because, oh, by the way, when you translate the product, way more people can use it.

And so translation itself, internationalization is a growth lever and we have product ways to do the translation with our users.

Yep.

And that''s what actually started even before the official growth team with Havi and that first hackathon.

Yes.

But that was the seed of this idea of like, oh, actually, the way to get past this growth wall as people Refer to it in retrospect that we''re hitting is use the product itself and internationalization.

There''s even more to it than what you said one When you have the users themselves who are translating a product as you''re seeding it in these new markets It''s there so much more bought in and like feel a sense of ownership over it versus like, oh, I''m just air dropping this, you know, translated American product onto your country here.

So it''s not just that it''s a better translation.

It''s that like you''re actually seeding those first power users who are gonna be deeply engaged and feel ownership over the product.

Yeah.

And then too, the nuance in like this local markets that might even be in the same language.

I mean, Spanish is the perfect example.

Spanish is spoken in so many places around the world, but like the local nuances and needs in Spain are like super different than Mexico, or Argentina, or Latin America, et cetera.

That''s exactly right.

And I think my point with all of this is A, growth is a pretty new discipline in our industry.

Two, growth is not marketing.

It''s very tempting.

You see, especially with incumbents, like big Fortune 500 companies who have someone who''s title as growth and then you ask them what they do and you''re like, oh, no, that''s not growth.

That''s marketing.

You don''t actually modify the product at all.

So that''s a different thing.

And it''s important to realize, like, not only did Facebook kind of invent the discipline, they are perhaps still the best at it.

They really eat, sleep, and breathe the idea that growth comes from product.

Yeah.

It was that core initial team, all of them, of which Havi, Havi''s now the COO.

Alex, Alex is now the CMO of Meta.

Naomi, Naomi is now Meta''s longest tenured employee besides Mark and runs a ton of stuff at the company.

And Shamath who deserves so much credit for starting the team, pulling it together, protecting it, advocating for it within the rest of product in the way that only Shamath can.

Man, it really is crazy with the Facebook diaspora.

We''re going to keep seeing this as we go along.

There''s other names where people will be like, whoa, I didn''t realize they were at Facebook, but many of the names that have come up so far, yeah, the diaspora is pretty talented.

Yep.

So there were a million things that growth did over the years within, you know, the blue app and then ultimately within all the apps at Facebook.

Growth today is a core center of excellence discipline that spreads across all the products at the company at Meta.

But the other big thing in the early days besides internationalization is people you may know, which crazy, like the carousel of people you may know on Facebook is still a core part of the blue app to this day.

Dude, I just got lost in it.

Did you know that that''s what I was looking at right now?

No. I was sanity checking.

I was like, oh, is that person part of the original growth team?

And I opened Facebook.

The newsfeed distracted me.

I scrolled down the stories at the top.

I scrolled down one post below that first post was an ad.

Below that is people you may know.

And I am like three panels over in people you may know because I was like, oh my gosh, I''m not friends with them.

We''re doing a podcast together live.

and I just had that experience.

Totally.

People you may know become such an important lever.

And I love it.

I love it.

Okay.

So people you may know become such an important lever.

Yes.

For a whole bunch of reasons.

The growth team discovers you were talking about analytics and data and really understanding what''s happening.

The key thing that they discover for new years who''s joining Facebook about whether they become an engaged, active, you know, evangelizing user or not, is how many friends they get in the first, like, I think it''s 24 hours or 48 hours, like short period that they''re joining the network.

And there''s like a certain number of active friends that you need.

Oh, this is funny, by the way.

I watch two different talks by people on the early growth team.

And one of them cited 10 friends in 14 days, the other cited seven friends in 10 days of, you know, how do you create the magic moment?

Alex Schultz, who''s now the CMO, gives this great talk, gosh, a decade ago at startup school with Sam Altman.

And he makes a point, look, it''s kind of a linear thing.

Yes, you want as many friends as possible in the least amount of time.

It''s not like, oh, magically at 10 friends in 14 days, it''s like super different than nine friends in 14 days.

But you just set a threshold somewhere and you set the threshold and then you''re like, okay, if we can deliver this delightful experience where now people have a rich news feed and the people they care the most about in the world to interact with, they''re going to retain.

Yep, totally.

The other thing is it marries perfectly with all of the investment that is going into the algorithmicization of news feed because choosing who to show you in that carousel of people you may know is like all the difference in the world, you know, show you seven randos and like you''re going to turn, show you your seven best friends and you''re going to friend them all and become an engaged user.

I''m so excited for I guarantee you at least one of the people that I just friended is going to be listening to this podcast and realize what just happened because I haven''t friended anyone on Facebook in years and I just sent out like three or four.

They just reengaged you as a user.

I love it.

Yes, they just have to new growth tactic have people do podcasts about the company and then.

I think people cut onto that one a while ago.

Yes, but yeah, like that''s a super hard data problem of like cold new user coming into the network.

How are you going to accurately predict who their best friends are who are already on Facebook?

Well, if you''re on the web and this is the late 2000s, you ask them to authenticate their web-based mail service of choice and then find out who they''ve been emailing and then use that to figure out who their friends are.

Magic.

Magic.

Oh, you know, there''s other less nefarious ways, you know, see who has sent them links in the past, who are also logged in Facebook users.

There''s all sorts of stuff you can do, but yes.

So by the end of 2008, thanks to the growth team.

Growth is like really going again.

They go from just barely getting to 100 million users in August of 2008 to almost 150 million by the end of the year.

So 50% growth in the last four months of the year.

And then 2009 is just like lights out.

They grow 250% in 2009 to 350 million users globally.

Internationalization and is like really firing on all cylinders here.

That''s right, they went from 150 million users to 350 million.

No, in like one year, isn''t that wild?

Crazy.

The other core piece of the stat whenever you''re looking at growth, this will look at engagement.

Engagement in 2008 was also in the doldrums.

50% of monthly actives were daily actives.

And from what I can tell, that basically was just an artifact of, as the company got bigger, Every marginal user they added was sort of less engaged than the early core users, you know, when they went from colleges to high schools to open registration, it just was going to have slightly less product market fit.

But growth team is focused not just on growing new users, actually an even better lever.

Every long-term goal is retaining your existing users, and the best lever for retention is engagement.

And so that was where a huge amount of their energy went.

So this is really interesting.

50% of monthly actives were daily actives in O8.

Since then, they have basically improved that metric every year.

There''s been a little bit of variance, but it is now almost 70% today.

Been a maniacal focus on how do we make as many monthly actives daily actives as possible, year over year over year over year.

That''s wild.

And that figure is just in the blue app in Facebook.

that is just in the blue app, yep, exactly.

Wow.

Well, on the engagement front in 2009, the big thing that happens there is like button.

You know where I''m going with this, like button.

Yep.

And I know you know who invented the like button.

Cause it wasn''t Facebook.

I don''t know.

Friend feed.

Oh, no way.

Brett Taylor and Paul Bukay invented the like button.

How did that work?

Because FriendFeed would just federate stories from other social networks into one aggregated feed.

Yep.

I don''t recall exactly.

Did it only store that information on FriendFeed and not propagate it back?

I suspect that''s probably it.

Like they probably felt like they needed some sort of, like, hey, native mechanic on FriendFeed.

Man, FriendFeed was so awesome.

It''s funny in this era where I''m now checking multiple feeds every day, Twitter, threads, Instagram, all the messaging services to catch up on my messages, occasionally the blue app.

I kind of need friend feed again.

That was like the most amazing product.

I know.

I know.

The world is so vulcanized, it''ll never happen.

But yeah, I mean, talk about another amazing part of the Facebook diaspora, Facebook with later acquire friend feed, Brett Taylor would become.

CTO, when Adam Dantleau left to go start Cora, and then when Facebook acquired friend feed, Brett became CTO.

And then famously Brett becomes the co-president of Salesforce by way of acquisition, and then eventually board chair at Twitter when the whole X thing was going on, and now he''s on the board at OpenAI.

Yep, board chair, I think at OpenAI.

Crazy.

Andy''s got a new start above his own, so I''m telling you, the talent that moved through that place.

Well, and Paul Buckeye, the other friend feed founder invented Gmail created Gmail within Google.

Yeah.

So he ended up at Facebook for a while then after I forgot about Paul too.

It''s unbelievable.

Yeah, he must not have stayed very long if at all.

Yeah.

Because he went to YC I think after that.

Okay, so friend feed invents the like button.

Facebook I believe was going to call it the awesome button.

And then at some point, right before launching, I think Mark personally made the call, it''s just too weird.

Let''s go with like, yes.

The story as I understand it is that Facebook had been considering something like this for a long time.

I mean, the benefits are obvious, right?

Like if you have a lightweight way to engage and feed more data about positive votes on and posts into the newsfeed algorithm, like that''s gonna really turbocharge things.

On the flip side, the concern was that it would actually decrease meaningful engagement.

There''d be less comments.

Exactly.

And so ultimately, they started running some tests with like small user groups and specific geographies, and they found that it actually often boosted engagement of comments.

Fascinating.

That''s why you test things, you never know.

Exactly.

So yes, they launched the like button and that becomes huge for overall engagement, But also, more importantly, for just improving the algorithm, which is now starting to kick in and newsfeed and making sure you''re seeing stories that you really care about.

And the like button then also got used for pages.

And it became this sort of form of capital among brands of how many Facebook likes does your company have, which for a while actually meant you could organically get messages out to them.

every time you posted it was as if a company was a person and you just show up in the feed before Facebook ultimately was like, those are advertisements, you''re going to pay us for those.

Yes, you''re exactly on the right track.

Let''s flip back now to Cheryl and building the advertising business right around the same time we''ve decided like, okay, yes, we''re going to be in the advertising business and to do that right, to do that natively, to do that in a way that generates defensible, sustainable value for Facebook.

That means targeting.

And the like button is the perfect gift to this.

Because all of a sudden there''s this really lightweight way to engage with things to signal your preferences about what you like.

Yep.

And the like button ended up being the perfect Trojan horse to move Facebook platform form off of Facebook.

So there was a reason for third party websites to embed Facebook''s JavaScript in their pages.

Because of course, you''d want to be able to like an article or like a brand all up on their website.

You know, how many Facebook likes do you have?

If that''s what matters, we want people clicking like on our website too, not just over on Facebook.

And so suddenly now every company on earth has some Facebook and has a reason to embed some Facebook JavaScript right there on their page, which my goodness, that''s going to serve as a great signal back to the advertising algorithm where we can drop cookies and we can see who is moving around the web in what ways.

So it''s perfect for platform, but it''s also perfect for feeding data into their advertising system.

Now that they have something that brands and third party websites are incentivized to drop right on their page.

Yes.

apps are freaking lootly.

So we talked about growth reigniting at the end of 2008 into 2009.

The business is also on fire in 2009 in a good way.

So platform still rocking and rolling, Microsoft display ad partnership still growing strong as growth is happening.

Now under Cheryl, you finally got real native, highly targeted ads coming online in Facebook.

But in 2008, the company had done 280 million in revenue up from 153 the year before in 2007.

2009, they do almost 800 million in revenue.

He''s crushing it.

2010, an even two billion in revenue.

They''re now very, very cash flow positive.

Yes, reaching the scale that Google was at their IPO.

So 2010, they hit 600 million users, 2011, 850 million users, 2011 revenue grows almost to another 100% to 3.7 billion.

It''s like, all right, time to start thinking about taking this company public.

It''s also time to start thinking about what is our biggest existential threat.

It''s so funny that we''re talking about.

And the existential threats are over.

We''ve won.

We have platform going well, we have this advertising business going well, we''re getting data from the open web because we have like buttons everywhere, everything is going our way.

We finally have it dialed and none of that matters in a mobile world as people shift from spending time on the web to other apps that open web data used as signal goes away.

All of your ability to take payments, by the way, Facebook had launched payments.

At some point, they started requiring apps to use their virtual currency.

Facebook credits.

Facebook credits.

That''s right.

All of these amazing pillars that they''ve built were for the open web and created the most incredible business-known demand and mobile is a completely different thing.

Yep.

That seed from five years ago that has been growing a mobile is finally going to turn into a big big big problem for the company.

All right, so let''s just get into it.

I thought it would be fun.

I listed out all of the ways that I could think of that mobile was a big problem for Facebook.

One, and I think this is kind of like the Uber problem that everything else is downstream of.

iOS and Android are closed proprietary ecosystems not controlled by Facebook.

Yeah, you can argue Android is open source and all that, but for all intents and purposes, Google controls it and they control the play store.

Put another way.

The web is the only open platform in history.

Yes.

And Facebook was born on the web.

I mean, how crazy is it that they could build Facebook on entirely free technologies at the beginning and then get distribution just by people sharing you are else around, browsers are interchangeable, operating systems are interchangeable, it works on any device that anyone wants.

Yeah.

If you live on the web, you have infinite degrees of freedom and flexibility to control your own destiny.

Yeah.

And Facebook had kind of built this, you know, walled garden on the web and it was pretty nice.

Yep.

And walled gardens are great as long as the foundation under you can''t shift.

Yes.

Build your walled garden directly on the earth, not on someone else''s foundation.

But okay, specifically, why is iOS and Android being closed proprietary ecosystem such a problem?

That means my number two reason, platform, which is 50% or more of the value of Facebook in their minds at this point in time, no longer works at all.

Like, full stop, flip a switch, does not work, will never work at all ever again on these platforms.

And why is that the whole premise of platform is you can run apps inside of Facebook On mobile you will never be able to run an app inside another app Just not gonna happen.

Apple''s never gonna let it happen and Google''s never gonna let it happen And that''s primarily because of that thing around you can''t launch an alternative app store Right.

Yeah, I mean, it''s the core part of their business model are the apps Not to mention if you are paying for things on their phone you have to use their payment system.

So Facebook credits ain''t going to work because you can''t charge 30% on top of 30%.

Yeah, and there''s technical aspects to this too, right?

Like code runs in native code on these devices as opposed to open HTML on the web.

Right, you get told what your development environment is.

This is the language.

These are the frameworks.

These are the APIs you''re allowed to call.

Yep.

So, okay, greater than 50% of, you know, the revenue and the sort of like...

theoretical future value.

inherent theoretical value and strategy of the business.

Necap it gets worse.

Facebook and Mark and Cheryl have been hard at work building the other core pillar of the business.

This new super sexy targeted ads business.

Well, guess what?

All of the ads that are running on Facebook at this point in time are running on the right-hand column on the website.

There is no right hand column on a mobile app.

There''s only room for a feed, which to this point in time has never had advertising in it.

And in fact, there''s like a cultural allergy to the idea of polluting the beautiful pristine organic news feed with an ad.

We don''t require big cultural change.

This is why you can''t make up this stuff in these stories that we tell.

Facebook has, Because I kid you not no way to make money at all on mobile.

Here is an actual honest to God statement that is in Facebook''s S1 that they filed before the IPO in 2012.

I am reading as a quote, we had more than 425 million monthly active users who used Facebook mobile products in December 2011.

We anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile users will continue to exceed the growth rate of our overall MAUs for the foreseeable future and our users could decide to increasingly access our products primarily through mobile devices.

Which let''s be clear, comparing those growth rates, another way to simplify that and say it is our user base is shifting to mobile from desktop.

Another way to simplify that is our desktop business is going to zero.

Yes.

Now, the kicker.

This is a statement in the S1.

We do not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from the use of Facebook mobile products and our ability to do so successfully is unproven.

Accordingly, by our stock.

Yeah.

Accordingly, if users continue to increasingly access Facebook mobile products as a substitute for access to personal computers, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users, our revenue and financial results may be negatively impacted.

Yeah.

No kidding.

Oh my God.

I''m still not done.

That''s only reason number three.

Okay.

Reason number four.

Another benefit of the open web is that you can push code whenever you want.

You can make changes rapidly.

You can move fast.

You can break things and then you can fix them rapidly.

This is how Facebook has always operated.

On mobile apps, you can push code when Apple and Google tell you that you can push code.

And at this point in time, there was approximately a two-week delay between pushing an update and it being reviewed and accepted.

Not only was there a two-week delay, during that two weeks, Apple and Google are reviewing and if they see anything that they don''t like for whatever reason they are telling you, no, you cannot push that code.

Or your company could be in a fight with that company and they could decide, ah, I don''t think you should push any updates for a while until we resolve our fight.

Yep.

Okay, so that''s number four and then that brings me to number five reason that I could think of of why this is really bad for Facebook.

The competitive field is about to get a total reset.

On the web, Facebook is dominant.

Network effects are super real.

Everything we talked about in this whole first part of the episode, if they can suck up all of the new social functionality that that they are anyone else in vents, they can put it into the main Facebook app, photos, chat, platform, newsfeed, et cetera.

On mobile though, Facebook is just one icon of many on the home screen.

Exactly.

And the wisdom at the time was that mobile apps should be narrow in their functionality, and you did not expect a single app to bundle in a ton of different use cases.

It''s super easy for users to be like, hmm, okay, I get this utility from Facebook, but like, Well, I don''t know, here''s this Instagram thing, like that''s kind of cool.

I get great photo utility from that, which also lives on my home screen right there, and I''ll still use Facebook for seeing when my friends get married, but like photos cool.

And messaging, you know, this WhatsApp thing is super cool.

Like, if you just use that for messaging.

It''s super easy to use one app for one thing and other apps for others.

And you can see why Facebook adopted that sort of early 2010s constellation of apps strategy.

For a while, they had slingshot, poke, messenger, paper, rooms, riff, camera.

The belief by a lot of companies for the direction mobile was going was there''s going to be specialized apps each for their own tiny little purpose.

That''s not great if a lot of your value is we bundle a lot of stuff in to create the most user engagement to all feed into each other for people to use all these different components of our application.

Yep.

Totally.

Okay.

Those are my short list of five reasons of why the shift to mobile is dangerous to Facebook.

Anything else you would add?

No. So they''re going public right into this.

For the first time since our business is founded, we face a real existential threat completely out of our control that is going to make the next few years look really bad.

Let''s go public.

Yeah.

Well, let''s talk about that IPO.

Yes, but first, it is time to talk about one of our favorite companies, Statsig.

A phrase that many of you will know from Facebook''s early days is move fast and break things, but despite instilling this in Facebook''s engineering culture, Facebook didn''t actually break very often, and it essentially never goes down now.

How?

Well, Facebook invested hundreds of thousands of engineering hours in a set of internal tools.

These tools let any engineer set up new metrics, ship new features, and measure performance in real time.

This meant that anyone could just ship a new feature.

But they always had metrics to use as guardrails, and they could always roll back the feature if anything broke.

They took this so far that they have every new engineer ship a feature on their first day at the company.

Wild.

You might wish your team could build products like Facebook, right?

Ship fast, make data informed decisions, iterate rapidly, but you don''t work at Facebook and you don''t have those tools.

So you''re stuck, right?

Well, not anymore, thanks to Statsig.

Statsig was founded by an X-Mediteme three years ago with a mission to make these same tools that Facebook has available to any company.

Could there be a better sponsor for this episode, David?

This is insane.

I know.

It''s perfect.

That''s perfect.

Today, they''ve done it, combining tools like feature flags, product analytics, experimentation, and observability into one connected platform that runs off one set of data and infrastructure.

No more stringing together expensive point solutions and internal builds, and no more using technology vendors built five or 10 years ago when the needs of modern product teams have grown by leaps and bounds.

And they''ve also gotten some crazy traction over there at Statsig.

Many of the world''s leading tech companies rely on them, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Notion, Anthropic, Figma, plus thousands of early-stage startups.

In fact, their scale has gotten so crazy that they process over a trillion events per day.

For any engineers listening, they have a great blog post about how they do this.

And best of all, Statsig is pretty affordable.

They have an insanely generous free tier for small companies, a startup program with one billion free events, which is $50,000 in value, and significant discounts for enterprise customers.

To get started, just go to statsig.com slash acquired and remember to tell them that Ben and David sent you.

Thanks, statsig.

All right, so David, here we are.

We''re going public despite everything you just listed that is wrong with the future of mobile and this company.

Oh, man, which seems like a not very smart idea, right?

And, you know, like one thing about Mark Zuckerberg, you could say lots of things about him, but one thing I don''t think anybody could say is that he''s not smart.

So what gives, why are they doing this?

Well, back then, once a company crossed 500 shareholders, the SEC actually mandated by law that you had to start reporting quarterly like a public company.

Whether or not you were traded on an exchange.

Whether or not you were traded on an exchange.

And at the end of 2011, Facebook crossed 500 shareholders.

So, for Facebook, this means that they were going to have to report like a public company anyway.

And in practice, the common wisdom was you have to go public as part of this anyway, because otherwise you''re going to report and then you''re going to lose all the momentum and excitement about having an IPO and doing an S1 and having a big road show, et cetera, et cetera.

So you might as well just do the IPO as long as you''re going to have to do this.

And I think Mark and Cheryl and the team, like really debated, like, well, should we skip the IPO?

But like, well, shoot, then we''re going to be reporting as a public company and heading into all of these headwinds without having actually gone public and raised the money that we might need to be able to make these investments.

So they''re like, nope, we got to just do it and go public.

Yes, it is a odd time to go public, given everything with mobile.

And of course, they''re being forced into it.

There actually are a couple of kind of tailwinds that they have that are probably worth touching on here.

The first of which is they had just beat Google Plus, Facebook treated this like a total existential threat.

We laugh about Google Plus now.

It''s a butt of jokes, but that''s because Facebook was so effective in competing against it.

I''m not saying the product itself was amazing and it would have been fine without Facebook, but like Google did not end up executing that well on that product.

It actually is a really good point though.

Google plus may or may not have been a good product and may or may not have succeeded, but the Facebook competitive response was like.

Unbelievable.

Unbelievable.

I mean, this is like the growth team plus Facebook''s engineering culture at its finest in defeating this.

Whether or not they executed the product well, Google was the big web tech company at the time and they put a ton of resources and a lot of their best people on it.

And they had Gmail.

And they had Gmail, right.

Right.

So it''s interesting to look at this because Google basically is Facebook''s biggest business model comp.

They show ads on the web and they monetize that really well.

This theoretically could have been in their wheelhouse.

This is just more real estate to show ads on the web.

And they''ve already got all these people with user accounts.

You can see why Facebook took this really seriously.

We''ve talked a lot about Facebook''s technical prowess.

Well, here is an example of where it really kicks in when you need it to be a key competitive advantage.

So they structured themselves in a way that encouraged flexibility of engineers.

And they really broke from the tide of microservices in this era.

They had one monolithic code base that everyone worked out of.

And you might say, well, that''s stupid.

Why would they?

That''s not the way the world was going.

But what they basically did was they wanted to encourage portability of teams.

If you''re an engineer, you get hired into the company, not onto a team.

You learn the company''s codebase.

You learn the company''s conventions, and you can easily sort of move around after that.

You do have to deal with the trade-off then of you have this big model of the codebase with gigabytes of PHP code for thousands of engineers.

What do you do about that?

Well, then they just had their cake and eat it too.

They would go and have the infrastructure team figure out how to deal with that problem, rather than saying, oh, everyone can just work in their little silos.

And so that meant that engineers could kind of be quickly re-orged.

They could have this company wide lockdown to fight Google Plus.

And they did all sorts of things.

They launched video calls to compete with Hangouts.

They launched something to compete with Google Circles.

But either way, they could really quickly reallocate resources and people who sort of knew how to work together to defeat what could have really been an existential threat from their biggest similar company.

Oh, man, Mark famously in an internal speech around this, you know, referenced what was I think Kato the elder from ancient Rome of Carthage must be destroyed.

Yep.

There is a second way in which things had settled down and now was a good time to go public.

And that''s around privacy.

Facebook had just been, I mean, playing way too fast and loose with user privacy for years and it had finally caught up with them by 2011.

and just to jog your memories, I''m sure people may remember a lot of these.

Some of these included, even though users could restrict the audience of their posts with a setting, this apparently didn''t apply to apps, which could access these posts regardless of how you restricted the audience.

And for a time, this even included when your friends installed an app too, you didn''t even have to grant the permission yourselves.

Similarly, they made friend lists public without user consent at one point.

And Facebook could decide without user consent to change private fields of your profile to be public.

And this wasn''t always messaged as clearly as it could have been to users.

So to remedy this, they had just signed what is called a consent decree with the FTC, the US Federal Trade Commission in 2011.

And they promised to make a bunch of changes regarding user privacy issues going forward.

And so all this was behind them now.

Now, and interestingly, David, an FTC consent decree is the same thing that Microsoft signed.

Yeah, hark back to the Microsoft episode.

Yes, the FTC consent decree with Microsoft was the predecessor to the big DOJ suit.

In this case, the FTC consent decree is the predecessors to what eventually would become the Cambridge Analytica settlement.

So here in 2011, the way that they settled this is there''s a bunch of provisions that with Facebook promising they''ll be tighter on making sure user data is treated in a very particular way.

They''re subject to audit every year, for two years, for the next 20 years.

You know, there''s there''s all these things that they sort of agree to.

But, you know, once you sign a consent decree, it''s like, okay, we''re through it.

We don''t have this thing hanging over our heads.

We can go public and say, oh, yeah, that''s in the past.

We''ve taken care of it.

That''s another reason to go public right now.

Yeah, it''s such a good point.

There actually was this little window here at the beginning of 2012, where desktop revenue to hadn''t yet been impaired so badly that they could still show growth.

They had these couple little wins they could point to and say like, all right, not great, but like if we''re gonna do it, we gotta do it now.

Yeah, you could almost look at it like a little bit of a win of everyone knows us as the company that is a little bit dodgy on privacy practices.

Like at least the public perception is this, that they''re constantly changing the terms of the game.

from shall we say?

Yes.

To the company''s advantage when it was confusing or misleading to users.

Now you can say, look, not only do we sign that, we have these five product initiatives in place where we''re just buttoned up now.

I actually think that''s pretty true.

I think they became a company that had rigorous privacy practices because of some government regulation when they otherwise may not have.

If you look at the early days of what you could do as a developer on platform, it was pretty wild west.

And so I''m not saying it''s fully because of the consent decree, but they could definitely tell a story around, look, we made some mistakes.

We got some things wrong in privacy.

And going forward, we''re in good shape.

We''re all good.

Yeah.

Well, we''ll come back to that in a little bit.

But for the moment, the IPO February 1st, 2012, they filed the S1.

They entered the traditional quiet period before the IPO where legally, according to the SEC, once you have filed for an IPO, all material information about the company needs to be included in the S1 registration statement.

You can''t go give interviews, you can''t go talk to the press, you can''t say anything meaningful about the company besides what is fully publicly disclosed to any potential investor in the S1 statement.

And then a week later on April 9th, 2012, during the quiet period, Facebook acquires Instagram for a billion dollars times now, baby.

Time is now.

And they can''t say anything about it besides what they file in the amended S1 because they''re in the quiet period.

Amazing.

The company''s previous largest acquisition was $70 million.

Obviously this is a way different thing.

Now, sitting here today, you might be really tempted to say, oh, well, there''s the fix for mobile.

They just bought Instagram.

That solved all the problems, except not because Instagram didn''t have any revenue on mobile either.

It''s like, you know, you''re tying one anchor to another here.

Well, not to mention, Instagram had 27 million users.

Facebook had 900 million users.

This was potentially a problem for a future Facebook, but this was not currently a problem.

Totally, I was just about to say that too.

Like, yeah, also not currently a fix to Facebook''s major problem of the shift to mobile.

And I mean, my God, talk about the Hutzba of Mark to do this.

You''re already in a really challenging period for the company, a really challenging IPO process.

you just entered the quiet period and you decide to spend a billion dollars on something with 27 million users in no revenue and you''re not going to be able to talk about it except what you file with the SEC.

Wow, you got a really, really, really freaking believe in the future potential of your company and the combined companies of Facebook and Instagram here to make this move.

Not to mention, on top of it all, we''re not going to go into it here because we had a whole episode on Facebook and Instagram.

But this was done over two days over the course of a weekend.

Mark didn''t do a whole lot of socializing this before pulling the trigger.

He just knew it was the right thing to do and did it.

Yep.

And then it ended up working out pretty well in the long run.

In the short run, yet another question, Mark, to add to the already very large pile around this company.

Finally, long road show process by the week of May 14th, they''re ready to price the IPO.

pricing is set for Thursday night, May 17th, 2012.

On Tuesday, May 15th, General Motors, GM, who by the way was not a particularly large Facebook advertiser, announces publicly to the world that they are pulling all their spend off of the Facebook platform because it''s not effective.

Not really what you want to have happen to nights before you price your IPO.

was that motivated by someone that feels like a hit feels like it must have been I''ve never heard one where the other but like a why would you announce that publicly b why would you announce it publicly right then like there''s for sure more to that story nonetheless Facebook goes ahead Thursday night they priced the IPO at $38 a share at the very top end of the range after the road show again the That''s by here.

They raise $16 billion at a $104 billion market cap, making it, I think, the third largest IPO of all time at that point, behind Visa and ironically, General Motors coming out of the bankruptcy during 2008.

Which both of those are mature companies that are going public under weird circumstances.

Those are not comps.

Totally, yes.

By far, the largest IPO of a new startup company in history, On Friday morning, trading starts.

The NASDAQ is overloaded with so many orders for buying and selling Facebook.

That trading in Facebook stock doesn''t actually open until 11.30 AM, which is two plus hours after the open on the markets.

Gotta be terrifying if you''re a big Facebook shareholder.

Yeah, that''s pretty terrifying.

Initially, it looks like that delay might have been good because the price shoots up to $45 a share from 38.

But then it crashes back down.

It is one of the most volatile trading days in any stock.

I think history on any exchange.

Facebook shares end the day at $38.23 up 23 cents from the IPO price, but only because all of the underwriting banks in the IPO stepped in to buy shares and support the price, which was totally crashing throughout the day.

Thank God they did it on a Friday, so everybody had the weekend to breathe.

Once trading starts again the following week, the price falls on nine of the next 13 trading days and ends up by the end of May down 25% from the initial IPO price of $38, kind of are ultimately bottoms out on September 4th, 2012, at $17.68 down 53.5% from the IPO price.

So market cap cut in, you know, over half in what''s that?

Five months since the IPO.

It wouldn''t end up reaching IPO price again until August 2013.

Anyone who bought at the IPO was underwater for 16 months.

Underwater for 16 months and five months later had lost half their money on Facebook.

So you have to have nerds of steel to even just keep holding.

I''m sure anybody who got back to even at 16 months was delighted.

Totally.

You''ve also got the employee lock up coming up around November.

So like now you''re staring down the gun of, shoot, I''ve already lost half of my value as a public company and pretty soon all the employees in the company are going to be able to selling, that''s going to put more selling pressure on the stock.

Holy crap.

This is pretty darn bad.

Yes, that is horrible.

I mean, losing 50% of your value as any company public or private, but especially public company is a disaster of epic proportions.

Having that happen immediately following your IPO, for most companies, there''s no way to come back from that.

you''re entering a death spiral, you''re going to end up being acquired, or you''re just going to get driven to zero, basically.

Yep.

And just to be super clear, desktop revenue wasn''t going to go to zero immediately.

But Wall Street investors are really worried that, hey, the world is transitioning to mobile.

Eventually, growth will start slowing, and it will start declining, which it does fairly quickly here.

And so like, if you can''t show me that you''re going to replace that with mobile revenue, why should I value your stock at anything?

Yep.

And so here is where founder control matters.

This is, David, it''s interesting you''re explaining the mechanics of a death spiral.

That would presume there''s a board of directors who feels a strong desire to do whatever is best in the interest of the shareholder.

And they might think that it''s these short term things.

But if you have a CEO who has a 20 year view and believes deep, deep in his heart that the best is yet to come and that this is just a temporary problem and that person controls the company and owns the majority of voting shares, you can withstand things like this.

You just better be right.

So, a little fun anecdote for everyone.

David and I, among the 20 other people we talked to to prefer this episode, one of them was Cheryl Sandberg.

And we were asking Cheryl, in particular, how did you start the monetization effort on mobile?

They were in the third column, there''s no third column on mobile.

What did you do?

And her comment to us was, oh, we just stopped caring about the right side ads on desktop.

And we took every engineering resource we could off of that and we put it on mobile and we knew we were going to miss the current quarter.

I think they missed a lot of quarters right after their IPO.

But this was us trading the present for the future and all we cared about was our future.

And she said, this is great quote.

This is up there with one of the best quotes on acquired of all time.

She was sitting there with Mark late at night and when they sort of arrived at this plan of we you''re going to forego a lot of desktop revenue to basically bet it all on figuring out mobile revenue.

She said, well, Mark, nobody can fire you and only you can fire me.

So if you''re in, I''m in.

And we buckled our seat belt and we said, here we go.

And it''s amazing.

I mean, that can only happen in a founder controlled company.

And it really did force them to figure out mobile advertising.

If they really are saying like, this is the new first class product, this is where we''re going to point all advertisers toward.

If they''re wrong on that, they''re wrong across the whole board.

Because if ads suck on mobile, since it''s the only thing and it''s filling up your whole screen, user engagement is also going to nose dive.

And so it''s basically a bed at all moment, where the ads are front and center.

So they must be good.

It is essential for the mobile product and thus your company for them to be good.

Users attention will be pointed at these ads.

Like no other ads, you have ever run before.

And actually, the flip side of this is ended up being the best thing ever for the company.

Because the ads are front and center, the value per ad is actually higher.

So they ended up creating a much, much more valuable ad unit than they ever had on desktop, purely because of this incredible attention on them when you''re scrolling in feed on mobile.

Necessity is the absolute mother of invention.

Yes, totally.

You have no choice, but to do your best work, and boy, didn''t work out fabulously.

Yeah.

Ben, nobody can fire you.

Well, I guess you can''t fire me either.

But either way, if you''re in the corporate structure required is still a little, it''s unclear.

But yes, totally.

So when we say taking your best, most trusted engineers, taking them off, whatever they''re doing, and putting them on ads, there''s actually an amazing story around this.

So Mark goes to someone within the company who he knows can just ship and get stuff done.

And that is Bos and your Bosworth, his old TA from Harvard.

Bos at this point is running the core profile and timeline within Facebook.

And Mark goes and talk to him and says, Boz, I think you should come work on ads to which Boz replies, okay, I mean, like I get we''re in this situation, but you know, Mark, like I can''t do this for too long because remember I''m getting married this fall and I''ve got this six month sabbatical plan for my honeymoon and my wife and I we''re gonna get travel the world.

It''s all like booked and paid for.

We''re gonna be out of the country.

And Mark is like, yes.

Yes.

Well, we''ve got a few months until then.

I think you should come over and work on ads.

I was like, okay, okay, I will do that.

I will come up with something here before the wedding.

So he teams up with Will Cathcart from the newsfeed team, from Chris Cox''s team, and they go get to work.

By the way, Will is the head of WhatsApp today.

And Boss, of course, is the CTO of Meta and head of Reality Labs.

And the first thing they do during these couple months is like, all right, we just need like a band-aid to stop the bleeding and at least produce some mobile revenue.

And what they decide to do is like, hey, we do have on mobile the carousel of people you may like.

What if we just slot some brands into that carousel and say, hey, in addition to people you may like here, here are some brand pages you may like, a reasonable first step.

And look, they knew that this wasn''t going to be the long-term solution and solve all mobile revenue that they could report.

And this was super important because as I alluded to, the lockup on employees and insiders selling their shares expired in November, they had to get something out that was going to prop the stock price up a little bit before naturally employees are going to start selling here and that''s going to put downward pressure on the stock price.

Yep.

Also, bummer, if you are an employee selling six months after that IPO, hopefully as many people held as they could get through it.

Yes, hopefully.

And I think most people who were at Facebook at this time really did believe in the future of the company.

At the same time, you have life circumstances.

You might need to buy a house.

You might need to do things for your family, et cetera.

It''s a tough spot.

So fall rolls around, they''ve launched sponsored pages you may like, Bos gets married, they''re is getting real honest to God native ads in the news feed, which frankly, they should have done years ago on desktop.

But like now, now the gun is to their head.

There is nothing in the mobile app except news feed.

We got to put ads in news feed.

So finally, at the end of the year, they launch it, boss is like, woo, okay.

Mission accomplished.

I can now leave on my sabbatical.

We can go on our honeymoon, but there''s just one problem.

Shipping this thing is only like 20% of the battle.

Now you have to go sell it to advertisers, which this is a whole new ad paradigm.

You got to like educate brands on why this is going to work for them, especially when your overall brand as a company and effectiveness of your advertising is kind of in the dumps right now.

And it''s an iterative process where you''re going to hear a bunch of feedback from brands and you''re going to say, oh, we had to modify the ad products, which still continues to this day that you roll out and modify ad products is not like a, all right, we now have ads in the news feed, we''re good.

The job is never done here.

So of course, quarterbacking all this is gonna fall to Cheryl and her team.

But again, as you said, Ben, this is an iterative process.

You can''t divorce product from the feedback from advertisers.

And the big advertisers are sure as hell gonna expect someone from product who is leading this thing to show up and tell them about it.

Yep.

So Boss kind of needs to come along to these meetings.

So on December 18th, Boss remembers the exact day, Mark calls him up and is like, Boss, great job working on ads.

Hey, I really still need you to come back and work on ads.

Boss is like, no way, man.

I did the past six months for you.

I just got married.

I''m going on my honeymoon, I''m out.

Mark''s like, okay, okay, okay.

The next day, calls him back December 19th and he''s like, buzz.

I just want to say really, really great job again.

And you know, the company''s in a really tough spot.

And like, I really think that you should come keep running ads here.

And buzz like, okay, all right.

I will reduce my sabbatical from six months to six weeks.

I''ll take the holidays, the beginning of the year.

I''m going to cancel the last four months of my trip.

I will do six weeks with my wife and then we''ll fly her friends out to the last two weeks with her and then I''m going to go fly around the world with Cheryl on a very different kind of trip here.

So that''s what they do and for most of 2013, Bosn Cheryl are out on the road.

They''re pitching advertisers, they''re explaining sponsored stories in the newsfeed on mobile, why this is so important.

And not only do advertisers need education about this new Facebook ad unit, they also need education about mobile advertising in general.

They''d only just gotten used to digital advertising on desktop.

Totally.

Do you remember those Mary Meeker decks that used to go around where they would show the mobile advertising, basically the shortcoming?

Look at all this attention that has shifted to mobile and yet the monetization just isn''t there.

And that was a story every year for like a decade.

Yep.

total.

And it was the same story with desktop on the web for a decade before that.

So what''s interesting is, as they''re getting going here, of course, advertisers don''t come in right away.

But also the ones that do come in early are, as you would imagine, not the best advertisers.

And so the whole effort starts to have this real problem where the ads that are now showing up in newsfeed are like pretty freaking crappy ads and Mark keeps getting more and more pissed because like obviously this is really important but he''s like boss Cheryl like why the hell is all this crap showing up in my feed like if this keeps happening I get that we have to save the business but like I care more about the user experience and like I''m gonna dial this back.

This is the most interesting thing at this point in history Mark is putting pressure on Bosn Cheryl to show fewer ads.

Yes.

And Bosn is the one with the contrarian view who comes to Mark and says, we''re thinking about this all wrong.

We actually need way more ads.

Not just a little more ads, huge amounts more ads because a great ad is on par with content.

And if you have tons and tons of ads, then we can do way better targeting.

Like you have this beautiful liquid marketplace of hundreds of thousands of advertisers, billions of users, and at any given time, somebody can see the optimal ad for them and get recommended an amazing product that perfectly fits their needs in that moment with messaging that''s perfectly tailored for them.

Great advertising can be great, but you need a really, really liquid marketplace and you need fantastic algorithms, which you can only have if you train them on tons and tons of data.

So like we actually need 10,000 times more ads than we have right now, not less.

It''s almost like the only way out is through.

We''re going down this path.

We must be extremely successful in order to be successful at all.

This was such a contrarian view and also right.

And I think only could have come from someone like Boz being focused on this problem because as a product person in an engineer it''s the only way that you''re going to have that insight that like, oh, this is the same problem we had when we launched newsfeed.

The way to fix newsfeed and to make it really, really awesome is more newsfeed.

And you know, his more data, right?

You''re the only way out is through.

Yeah.

If somebody had purely come, I think, from the advertising world, they would have been like, well, you know, that''s just the nature of advertising, right?

It''s attacks on the users, and that''s the way monetization of media works.

But like, Boss was like, no, no, actually, this is a relevance problem, and we can make this awesome.

And in order to make it awesome, we need a lot more of it.

Yep.

And basically, like, that''s what happened.

I mean, flash forward 10 years, I open Instagram to get great product recommendations.

Totally.

It''s actually kind of wild.

I believe this is true.

There are markets in the world today where I think meta has run this test, where if you turn off ads in the meta family of apps products, engagement in those products actually goes down, which is just like freaking wild.

You would think like, oh, wow, now I get to use meta products without advertising.

No tax on me like I''m gonna engage more like no it goes down.

That''s the definition of ads as content if that''s actually the case.

Totally wild.

So by the fourth quarter of 2013 which honestly in the scheme of things is pretty freaking fast.

The whole thing finally flips.

Facebook announces that mobile advertising is now 53% of revenue and total ad revenue for the company grew 76% year over year in the fourth quarter, which of course is the most important quarter of the year, which means I did all the math on that.

That means that all of desktop revenue, all of it.

So the old platform business, the old ad business, the Microsoft third parties ad serving, all of that actually shrank in the fourth quarter of 2013.

13.

So that''s the counterfactual here.

If Facebook had not gotten mobile monetization right, that''s what would have happened is Q4 2013, all of the growth momentum that it had would have flipped and it would have started the downward spiral.

And probably not that early if...

I guess that''s right, because all the resources got pulled off of it.

Exactly, but that''s what would have happened eventually to it.

Eventually, yep, yep.

Some man is like this wild 18 month journey, but it totally saved the company because now here they are, they''ve built this unique pioneering and totally defensible native mobile ad unit in the feed.

They define the whole generation of monetization here.

It''s the best ad unit in history.

It''s an ad that completely fills the screen on your device, and that users are okay with.

So this is the most insanely captivating, engaging ad unit that you could possibly ask for, and it came out of necessity.

It''s wild, the fact that they thought their backs were against the wall, they were totally screwed, and instead actually it''s the thing that monetizes better and is better for advertisers than any other advertising product they''ve ever had.

And I know we keep saying this, and it sounds maybe sort of silly, but like really better for users too, So, before this paradigm that they invent here of, you know, algorithmically driven ads in the feed, the biggest monetizing thing on mobile was an interstitial like pop up fricking display ad that took over your screen, right, like what an awful fricking experience for a user.

Right.

Right around this time too, the other thing that''s happening is kind of glossed over this for time.

But Facebook''s initial attempt at a mobile app was to try to work around all the constraints of the mobile app ecosystem.

And they thought, well, that''s nice that the app stores are going to try and box us in.

But we''ll just ship our mobile web views inside of a thin little app wrapper.

And that way we can deploy multiple times a day.

You know, we''re Facebook.

This is what we do.

It''s part of our culture.

It''s DML five.

Woo.

Provided a horrible user experience.

I mean, the engagement on the app was low, time spent was low.

It was a risk to start selling these ads because people don''t want to spend any time in the app, even without ads, let alone when you start layering these in.

And so they''re finally starting to sort of pull out of this tail spin.

They basically spent a year completely rewriting all their mobile clients to be these rich, beautiful, native experiences.

This is a thing that Facebook has always been good at.

Whenever they decide to do something, they go and recruit like the actual best talent in the world to do it, the group of people that they pulled together from Joe Hewitt forward to write their original iOS app, it''s just like some of the best iOS developers and designers in the world.

They hired Mike Mattis and the push pop press team when they acquired them.

That''s right, that''s right.

That became, I think it was creative labs, is that right?

Facebook creative labs, but a huge amount of that talent worked on their mobile apps, and so while they had the wrong strategy at first, once they got religion around native, they really created something probably one of the best apps ever on mobile.

Totally.

It''s funny.

I''m laughing.

You know, the version of history that we just told is maybe slightly too charitable to Facebook and to Mark because yes, it''s absolutely true.

They did the really hard thing.

They took the pain.

They invested in the future.

They built, you know, everything that would become Facebook and meta today out of it.

But the first reaction was to bet on hope as a strategy and bring your head in the sand and say, HTML5 is going to save us.

I don''t know that it was hope as a strategy.

I think it was more like if this can work, it''s going to solve a lot of our problems.

And I don''t think they correctly estimated how wide the user experience chasm is between web apps and native apps.

And I think they had to like have an app in market where users were actually using it to realize, oh, man, the state of the art in native that the platform vendors have developed iOS and Android is really, really good.

And they have brought very little of that to the web experiences, partially because of standards bodies, but also partially because it''s not really in their interests to make web apps great when they can force everything through a an app store that they have more control over.

So, okay, after the Q4 2013 earnings announcement, the stock pops way, way, way up to like 175 billion-ish market cap.

So up 75% from IPO, you know, what is that year and a half earlier.

And from there, it''s basically, if you look at the market cap chart, kind of a straight line journey from 175 five up to half a trillion over the next couple of years.

They eventually bring this whole native feed monetization engine over to Instagram and that works, obviously, incredibly well there, probably better than even on the blue app.

And that in particular, I mean, everyone''s going to laugh when we say this word, the legitimate synergy between going to an advertiser and saying, you can use this dashboard to get placements on Facebook and on Instagram is massive.

Both of those products monetize better than they ever could without that single channel that the advertiser only has to go through and use one dashboard to place on both products.

If you flash all the way forward to today, the lion''s share of Meta''s revenue comes from the ads that run on Facebook and Instagram.

Their whole business today can just be summarized as that.

Totally.

There''s another element for a couple of years that''s a big part of the native mobile revenue story and that is App install ads.

It actually is worth calling out because it plants the seeds of this much larger struggle that''s going to come in a little bit.

But a very large percentage of the inventory that they were selling and especially the revenue of these native mobile ads in the beginning was actually for App install ads that game developers and other folks were buying on Facebook.

So it was kind of like our old platform business all over again.

Facebook is actually the best place to discover apps on mobile.

Yeah, it''s pretty interesting realization where the big brand advertisers may not move to this new type of ad format right away, but the people that are going to be really hungry to move to that ad format are a game developer who makes a mobile app and wants to market their mobile app to to people who are A on that platform and B in a lean back experience where they''re open for some entertainment.

And when you are scrolling through a feed of your friends and brands and you are open to, oh, hey, look at this.

A game where I could click one button and then boom and install a game and play it.

Is there a better moment and channel to reach someone for an app?

No, I mean, even if you''re Apple, Apple doesn''t have a better way to do this.

people don''t search the app store for apps that often.

So you''d have to show them like a pop-up ad or something.

Facebook just has this opportunity where you''re in an experience where you''re open to some new form of entertainment and they have the ability to place a button there with rigorous targeting and incredible ad sales force.

Facebook was almost built to be the monetizable front end to the app store.

Oh, boy.

All right.

Put a pin in there.

Am I leading the witness too much, David?

Put a pin in that we are going to talk about Apple and Facebook in just a little bit here.

Now I said a minute ago that the journey to 500 billion in market cap from here is a straight line.

If you look at the market cap chart that''s true, internally within the company, I think almost certainly not there, a couple of big challenges that come up along the way.

During this period, you''ve got SNAP and you''ve got WhatsApp, both of which are like pretty big deals.

We''ve covered both of those pretty fully on separate episodes that you can go listen to.

But I think ultimately what they represent, obviously SNAP was more a competitor and WhatsApp turned into an acquisition and is now a big part of Meta and part of the company.

But I think together what they represent was this next fundamental shift in the consumer social landscape, which Mark totally picked up on and ultimately announced as the core of the company''s product strategy in 2019, which was the default social behavior was moving from town square, which was the old Facebook paradigm of like, hey, we''re all or public, here''s what I think.

Yup, and in many ways, Instagram was also town square.

Totally.

The Instagram team noticed over time that even before Snap started eating their lunch, that engagement would decrease.

The longer you stayed an Instagram user, because you over time being done with these permanent posts and you sort of saved it for the big announcements in your life, that there wasn''t a natural way to just effortlessly share, because when these platforms all started, everyone was in debt sharing with the town square the whole time.

And everyone was getting a little bit more clammy about that as time went on.

Yeah.

As the stage got bigger in the town square, it''s like, well, I''m not going to take the stage unless I like really have a great performance that I''m going to give.

And so every piece of data and metric that they had, you''re right, they sort of realized, oh, the world is shifting from town square to to living room is the way that Mark put it, that social was shifting from town square to living room.

Right.

And by living room, he means small private groups of super close relationships.

Yep.

And Snap and WhatsApp were both really interesting data points about this.

What''s app obviously with private messaging?

Snap also in its own way.

There was the original Snapchat use case of disappearing one-to-one photo messaging.

But stories really is where it became clear, Hey, this is widespread and this is a big problem that is going to threaten Instagram, Facebook, the whole default motion of like sharing beyond just a one-to-one messaging platform.

I want that to be much more private and locked down too.

If you own an engagement platform and someone figures out a new mechanic to make them much more willing to freeform share and your platform seems to encourage them to stay back, be quiet, and only post once in a while, maybe lurk, it''s not good.

Content creation on the platform going down is really, really bad if you are an engagement company.

Snap represents the idea that people are sharing way more if it''s a femoral and WhatsApp represented the idea that people are shifting the places they communicate from more public to more private and from larger groups to smaller groups, both of which are concerning if you are Facebook blue app.

Okay, so now, here''s an interesting question though.

How would Facebook know that attention is really shifting to these apps?

Because remember, we''re now in the mobile paradigm, not on the open web, where it surfaces like CommScore and Alexa and whatnot exist and you can see traffic and engagement competitively on other apps.

In the mobile ecosystem, it''s all siloed and locked down.

No, just Apple and Google really have that information.

Yeah, but somehow Facebook was able to get pretty good insights on what was happening in the landscape.

Well, to have that, you would either need to have some kind of SDK that gets bundled into apps like an analytics provider, or you would need like a VPN where like the traffic was going through it so you could see the traffic.

Well, in 2013, Facebook acquired a small Israeli company called Onovo.

Onovo was exactly what you just said, Ben, a VPN.

Actually, I think it initially started as like a data compression tool.

Also, if you were worried about your data plan, which was really important in many parts of the world, you could install Onovo on your device and it would compress the data and then serve it to your apps.

Eventually, that morphed into a VPN tool.

The net of that is that they could actually see traffic and usage data going into specific apps on mobile phones in their network.

Yeah, I think they looked at it as we need some way to level the playing field if we''re competing against Apple and Google in different ways and they have this data because they own the platforms, we kind of need to be able to see those same trends.

On the other hand, there is another way to view this.

If you''re looking for examples where Facebook may have considered their own interests over being forthright with users, over how their data is used, well, this could be another big example.

Users who were using Onavo didn''t download it with the intent of sharing their app usage data with Facebook.

Right.

They were just looking to compress their data or for a VPN service.

Either way, Onavo ended up being a hugely important acquisition for Facebook because it really tipped them off to WhatsApp and Snap 2.

Yeah.

Obviously, they fought those two companies in very different ways.

One thing they learned from fighting Twitter over the years is that there are these social mechanics or perhaps an interaction paradigm might be the right way to talk about it.

A post or a like or a retweet or a disappearing photo message.

And the thing that kind of matters is owning a valuable network.

The idea that people are going to come and give you their attention and you own the place that they connect with other people that they authentically verifiably know.

That''s the scarce commodity in order to kind of win the engagement game.

And the mechanics are actually kind of fungible.

And they''re totally a means to an end.

So if you discover some mechanic and you build this whole multi-hundred million user network platform, ad platform based on it, that''s great.

As long as no one comes up with a better mechanic than you and then goes and rebuilds the network somewhere else.

So one thing they learned with Twitter was, hmm, they seem to be growing really fast with this status update thing.

We need to look a lot more like status updates.

And that worked pretty well.

There were a lot of people that basically never switched to Twitter because they thought, oh, I can just use Facebook for this.

Yeah, and I already have my network in here.

I already have my friends, I already have my connections, totally.

And it also has photos.

So like Twitter is this weird esoteric text sharing thing.

I''m not really all about that.

I''m just going to keep using Facebook.

Oh, then Twitter did have photos for a while.

It was called Instagram.

Well, yeah, that API got turned off fast.

Yep.

So as they''re looking around at Snap, hey, someone has discovered this new stories mechanic.

My goodness, that is suddenly obvious that that is what the future is.

It now feels old to do anything else.

It''s kind of like when you got a retina iPhone for the first time and you''re like holding your non-retina iPhone and you''re like, this is instantly a piece of crap.

Like, I''m not ever gonna touch this discussing thing again.

I think when someone invents a new interaction paradigm, it''s one of these things where like, you have to adopt it.

Because otherwise, people are just going to flee.

And of course, your business depends on you adopting it, because you can''t let someone use this new discovered mechanic that''s perfectly timed for this moment in history with these set of cultural acceptances and this new set of technologies to go rebuild the network somewhere else.

And so I think the thing that they sort of discover is either through buying or through copying a mechanic, we need to protect our network by bringing these interactions into our family of apps, either by, as Ben Thompson would put it, the audacity of copying well or, of course, by buying them.

Yes, copying well or buying well.

Yes.

So listeners, of course, we don''t actually ever know what anybody''s intent is or what they''re thinking when they decide to buy a company or something like that.

This is just sort of David and I guessing at strategy from the outside.

We do have thanks to a court case, an actual email from Mark Zuckerberg on February 28th.

Oh, yeah.

This is so good.

2012 to their then CFO talking about the time they''re sort of discussing the Instagram acquisition, but laying out the idea behind an acquisition strategy.

The basic plan would be to buy these companies and leave their products running while over time incorporating the social dynamics they''ve invented into our core products.

One thing that may make neutralizing a potential competitor, More reasonable here is that there are network effects around social products and a finite number of different social mechanics to invent.

Once someone wins at a specific mechanic, it''s difficult for others to supplant them without doing something different.

It''s possible someone beats Instagram by building something that is better to the point where they get network migration, but this is harder as long as Instagram keeps running as a product.

Pause.

Which is pretty interesting.

That is the argument of why to keep Instagram separate and running as its own product is because Instagram''s already discovered this fascinating new mechanic around publishing one image at a time with these beautiful filters.

If anybody else tries to come after them, they''re already ahead.

So actually the best thing to do is own Instagram and let it keep doing its thing.

Anyway, resuming.

Integrating their products with ours to improve the service is also a factor, but in reality, we already know these companies social mechanics and we will integrate them over the next 12 to 24 months anyway.

The integration plan involves building their mechanics into our products rather than directly integrating their products, if that makes sense.

By a combination of these two things, neutralizing a potential competitor, integrating their products with ours to improve the service, one way of looking at this is that what we''re really buying is time.

Even if some new competitor springs up, buying Instagram, path, four square, etc.

Now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.

Within that time, if we incorporate the social mechanics they are using, those new products won''t get much traction because we will already have their mechanics deployed at scale.

It is God damn brilliant, David.

here''s my commentary based on all this.

It is so smart to basically say, well, if we buy them, we basically get two strategies that we get to execute at the same time.

One, we just leave them alone and let it keep succeeding.

It''s actually not a current potential thread.

We don''t know if it will turn into a potential thread.

Hell, Instagram wasn''t making any money yet.

that what''s app didn''t have a feed?

It was just a way people connected.

It''s not like just because they had a network, they were gonna turn it into a feed.

So there''s this idea that it''s not a competitor now by buying it, we basically get this option on if it becomes a competitor, if we completely leave them alone and let them decide what to do.

But then there''s also, look, we will integrate those mechanics into our core product, Facebook, the blue app, that already has well-built out network effects.

And by owning this thing that could become a competitor, there isn''t white space in the middle.

Anyone just like us is also going to take time, and they''re not going to do it as good as the original, and they don''t have our network, therefore whether the winner turns out to be the original product or us incorporating the mechanic into the blue app, we''ve won either way.

And probably what''s going to happen is both.

Yes.

So brilliant.

And that is what happened with Instagram.

What''s app is actually kind of different.

It never really turned into a competitor.

computer, it just serves a completely different use case and is also owned by Meta.

And then with Snap, they tried to buy Snap over and over again, and it didn''t work.

And so they basically figured out how to bring those mechanics into Facebook''s core products with stories in a way that Snap kept doing their thing, but there was really no reason to leave being an Instagram user because you already had that functionality with your own network anyway.

And here''s what''s really interesting about the stories, quote-unquote, story in Instagram and then ultimately coming to the blue app.

Stories as initially launched by Snap in the Snapchat app was a separate tab with a list of your friends who had published stories, who''s literally like a table, like a list.

Oh, I don''t remember that, really?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, it wasn''t, you know, the paradigm we all think of today as like the heads in the row at the top of your app, Instagram did that.

So when Instagram copied, quote, unquote stories and launched stories, they launched it as the algorithmically ordered row of heads at the top of your app.

And here''s where the internal advantages that Facebook, the family of apps had, they already had this world class ranking algorithmic expertise within in the company that was being applied to newsfeed, that was being applied to ads that was already starting to incorporate early ML and early AI, the beginning of Fair Facebook AI research lab had already happened here.

This was coming into the product.

Well, now when you''re launching a new feature like this in this case stories, you can say, oh, great, is this gonna be made better by our algorithmic and AI expertise?

Of course it is, let''s do that.

Right, that''s interesting.

Basically, even if you copy the feature wholesale, it''s actually even better, not just because you have the network, but because your algorithm tech is very advanced.

You can make sure it''s the most possible engaging version of that particular interaction design.

Yes.

So when Instagram, in those early days, when it was launching stories, they were optimizing the ranking of heads at the top of the app by how likely you are to tap on that person''s head.

Of course.

Of course they''re doing that.

I do want to jump forward to TikTok.

Yes, let''s do it because it''s a continuation of this story in a very different way.

In the mid-20 teens here, there''s a bunch of other stuff that we''ve got to get to, but TikTok is particularly interesting because it kind of blindsided Facebook.

Yes.

If you believe that the asset that matters is the authenticated real name network of people you actually know or people you care about following, you kind of think, oh, I always have a lead, as long as I can incorporate someone''s mechanic.

What if engagement is possible on an app that has nothing to do with your social network?

That''s terrifying because this big asset that you''ve built, this durable competitive advantage of we already have all the people, so why would you wanna go anywhere where your friends aren''t?

The magic of TikTok was AI suddenly in the late 20 teens became sufficiently advanced that it could show you the optimal thing created by anyone in the world, most of the time, you don''t actually know that person.

So suddenly, the only competitive advantage that Facebook the company has is people have a habit of tapping on their apps when they''re bored, but that''s a pretty thin competitive advantage.

That''s really easy to break.

Habits are changeable, especially on a mobile phone where another app is just an icon away.

Totally.

And so if someone is a great competitor like TikTok, who is incredibly well-funded, very good at strategically buying ads, has created their own growth function that is, there are just a very different animal and there are very well-executing machine.

And, you know, they obey a completely different set of laws, rules, regulation, norms, being a Chinese company, that created a competitor for Facebook that is more significant than anything they''ve ever faced.

This wasn''t like, oh, there might be an existential threat from this in the future.

This was like, oh, crap.

As soon as people form a habit around, oh, I just opened this black app with the white little music note on it, we have no more competitive advantages to throw at that problem.

So we must, as fast as possible, make something like reels just to stem the bleeding.

And then we can figure out what to do from there and hopefully get to a market stalemate with them.

Yeah, which is basically what has happened, but interestingly tick-tock and bite-dance its parent company, as you point out then, was so completely orthogonal to everything that Facebook had learned over the past 15 years, because yes, number one, most importantly, it''s not social media, it''s media, there''s no social, and your graph doesn''t matter anymore.

That''s a great point.

Right.

It''s digital media, it''s user created media, it''s mobile media, but it''s really not social media.

Yep.

Doesn''t matter who your friends are on TikTok.

What matters is in the first 10 videos you look at, is there AI pretty good at picking up the stuff that you care about and the stuff that you don''t?

It''s not, can you find a whole bunch of other people you know?

Yep.

And I really want to keep hitting on this insight again that Mark correctly identified of social shifting from the town square to the living room.

This is a second order effect of that shift that the company didn''t see coming because once you shift social from the town square to the living room, it now becomes possible to divorce media from social.

You''re already getting your social now in private in your digital living room.

The town square can become something that is completely not social.

Right, it''s turned into this pretty interesting dual pronged approach that they now have, which is you open Instagram and you have reels.

So the job to be done by TikTok is now done by a thing that you already have habit around.

It''s bundled into the place where you actually consume your social media.

Great.

That''s step one.

Step two is this is where it''s nice to have WhatsApp.

This is where it''s nice to have messenger.

For these living room style conversations where just a few of your friends, the new user behavior is I see a thing that got millions of views.

I can think of one or five people to share that with and then I have a private conversation about this public object in private.

I will share that on WhatsApp or I will share that on I message or I will share that on you know whatever my my actual friend living room network of choices and from where social networking started back in 2004 and ending up now in this reasonably complex interaction paradigm of I get AI-served videos from people I don''t know tailored to me and then I privately share those in multiple groups with those who I love and care about.

That''s a huge evolution.

It''s crazy that we use the term social network or social media for these two things that are like light years apart.

Totally.

The social and the media is now completely divorced and that is because of the shift from town square to living room.

Yeah.

We really need to evolve our or language around all this stuff.

Okay, so that, I think, is dimension one that TikTok is completely orthogonal to Facebook.

Dimension two is actually organizationally.

So TikTok, as we chronicled on our episode about it a couple of years ago, came out of Bydance.

Well, it was an acquisition of musically by Bydance and then Bydance turned it into TikTok.

Bydance had totiao before having TikTok.

Bydance is an AI company.

Bydance is not a product company, and the core product that Bydance makes is its AI.

Along with all sorts of other stuff, TikTok is like the product vector, one of many in the biggest, by which they deploy their actual product, which is AI.

This is very, very different from Facebook, which has always been a product company.

And so, like, organizationally, the way bite dance is set up is there these centers of excellence within the company, where the algorithms, the AI, that is controlled by a centralized team within the company, at least that''s my perception of how they''re different organizationally from how Facebook used to be.

Facebook and Facebook leadership was obviously watching this very, very closely.

And if you look at how meta is organized now, it looks a hell of a lot more like that.

So meta today is organized.

There are centers of excellence across the company.

Same way that I was just talking about by dance.

There''s fair.

That''s the fundamental AI research team.

There''s infrastructure shared across the whole company deployed to all the products and apps.

There''s revenue and monetization shared across the whole company deployed to all the products and apps.

there''s growth shared across the whole company, deployed across the various products and apps.

There''s integrity and safety, which is a big, big, big advantage that Facebook has.

They''ve reorganized how the whole company looks.

There''s still all the individual products in the family of apps.

Those all have their own heads, and they all roll up to Chris Cox who has had a product for the whole company and AI too, actually reports to him.

But all the infrastructure, all the revenue, all the growth, all the integrity and safety are decoupled from those actual products now and live in these centers of excellence across the company.

Fascinating.

And I think there''s a lot of bite dance influence in that.

Makes sense.

It''s the most formidable competitor they''ve ever faced and they really have no way to neutralize it.

Yep.

All right.

So all this talk of TikTok, them being an AI first company clearly met at today is an AI obsessed company.

How did that start?

Well, that is a great question, Ben.

But first, we''ve got a brand new partner to announce that we are very excited to share with you all.

Huntress.

Huntress is one of the fastest growing and most loved cybersecurity companies today.

Its purpose built for small to mid-sized businesses and provides enterprise grade security with the technology, services, and expertise needed to protect them.

Yes, they provide a revolutionary approach to managed cyber security that isn''t only about tech, it is about real people providing real defense around the clock.

So how does it work?

Well, you probably already know this, but it has become pretty trivial for an entry level hacker to buy access and data about compromised businesses.

This means cyber criminal activity towards small and medium businesses is at an all-time high.

So listeners, Huntress created a full managed security platform for their customers to guard from these threats.

This includes endpoint detection and response, identity threat detection and response, security awareness training, and a revolutionary security information and event management product that just launched.

Essentially, it is the full suite of great software that you need to secure your business plus 24-7 monitoring by an elite team of human threat hunters in a security operations center to stop attacks that software-only solutions can sometimes miss.

Huntress is democratizing cyber security by taking security techniques that were historically only available to large enterprises and bringing them to businesses with as few as 10, a hundred or a thousand employees at price points that just make sense for them.

In fact, there are over 125,000 businesses now using Huntress, and they rave about it from the hilltops.

They were voted the industry leader in endpoint detection and response eight times in a row and the industry leader in managed detection and response by customers in the G2 rankings for the second time this summer.

So if you want cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions backed by 24-7 expert humans who monitor, investigate, and respond to threats with unmatched precision, head on over to Contrist.com slash acquired or click the link in the show notes and just make sure to tell them that Ben and David sent you.

Okay.

So David met it today clearly an AI obsessed company.

How did that start?

Yeah.

So I mentioned this organization fair a couple of times.

I think it''s fair to go back and tell the actual origin of that because it''s really interesting.

Hey, it''s fundamental AI research.

Originally, it was Facebook, AI research, and now it''s fundamental AI research given the company is now met up.

So back in like 2013 timeline, when the company was finally fixing mobile coming out of the hellscape of 2012 of going through that transition during the IPO and the shift to mobile, Mark and the company''s VP of engineering, Mike Shrepfer, or Shrep, as he''s known, we''re trying to figure out like, okay, we''ve finally got a little moment to breathe here.

The Tiger isn''t chasing us at the moment.

Can we take a step back and try and figure out like, when is the Tiger going to jump out next and try and get us?

Yeah, or all these crazy things are happening because we''ve been having to play defense as user attention shifts with this new paradigm of mobile.

How do we not let that happen next time?

Like how do we play a more active role in whatever the future of technology is?

So we''re not getting whiplashed around and we can kind of control our own destiny a little more.

Yeah, basically not actually owning the platform sucks.

We''ve realized this now.

How do we make sure this never happens again?

Yes.

And that spawns some of the early work on AR and VR.

Come back to that in a sec.

And even this early in 2013 on AI, an AlexNet had just happened right at this time.

And for whole history of AlexNet, go check out our Nvidia series where we talk all about that and the importance to AI and ML.

And Facebook actually had a small ML team already at this point.

They were mostly doing computer vision.

The early machine learning folks at Facebook were mostly looking at, can we do automatic image tagging to reduce the, you remember how cumbersome it used to be when you''d upload a big batch of photos, then you had to go tag every single one.

And then somehow magically, I don''t remember the exact year, it was like all pre-suggested.

And you were like, whoa, this is pretty cool.

That was what the original ML folks at Facebook were doing.

Yep.

And Alex net and those big AIML breakthroughs in that era, where we''re all around image recognition.

And so Facebook was kind of already attuned to this.

So like, oh, okay, there''s like some pretty big technological stuff happening.

Maybe this is gonna be like the next platform vector of the future.

We should get serious about this AI stuff.

Yep.

So summer 2013, Mark and Shripp go out to recruit Jan LeCoon and convince him to come start an AI research lab at Facebook and Jan was then and is now one of the top AI luminaries in the field, top academics out there.

And Jan says, like, well, I''m flattered that you would want me to come work here.

That''s interesting, but like I live in New York, I teach at NYU, I don''t wanna leave, I don''t wanna quit teaching at NYU.

And I''m pretty darn committed to open source and publishing all the work that we do.

And Mark and Trevor are like, one, sounds good, you can stay in New York.

two, okay, you can stay at NYU, two, three, yeah.

We love open source.

We were built on the lab stack.

Great, publish everything.

We even talked about this at all at this very long episode so far, but Facebook had been doing a ton of open source publishing in basically everything they were doing.

They were open sourcing things like Cassandra and their back end, they were open sourcing front end frameworks, both on mobile and on web.

React, react native, yep.

Exactly.

They''d been open sourcing a lot of the language modifications they were making.

I don''t think open compute had started yet, but that was right around this time where they were starting to open source their data center designs.

Data center architecture.

Facebook definitely has a very particular open source strategy that we''re going to talk about an analysis, but needless to say, they have been advocates of open source since the very beginning.

Yeah.

So, Jan is like, wow.

Well, okay, when you put it that way, sure.

And what''s really important about how they do this is this is not Microsoft research.

This is not Blue Sky.

Yeah, let''s go focus on anything.

This is a highly focused AI research group.

We are going to research AI.

And I think that has kind of made all the difference.

It is super clear exactly how that is going to translate into helping Facebook and Facebook''s products.

This was pretty, I don''t want to say contrarian, that would have been wrong.

But it''s one of a dozen specializations of computing that you could have sort of glimpsed into for the future.

Yep.

And it was one of those earned secrets that Facebook had and Google had And at this time, you know, 2013, 14, 15 of like, oh, we can very, very profitably apply this work to our current products in social media feed recommenders.

Yes.

So it''s very funny that the rest of the world is having their AI moment now, because Meta had theirs in 2013, 14.

Before language models, like long before LLMs, Facebook realized they could profitably spend billions of dollars on AI systems to recommend A, what post you should see next in your feed, and B, what ad out of the entire inventory of ads we could show you.

What is the best one for you at this moment in time for that advertiser spend?

And today, there''s a lot of companies who are spending on AI in hopes that the use case materializes in the future.

Facebook''s is like wildly proven and has been for a decade and is incredibly profitable for them.

So that''s just like something to keep in mind whenever you''re looking at Facebook talking about AI today.

Yeah, there''s a lot of future-looking stuff they''re talking about, but it is already super at scale and a great business and has been for a long time and they''ve just been, you know, it''s like they''ve been quiet about it, but no one cared until now.

It''s one of the fundamental advantages that Facebook has today relative to all other AI companies is that they are guaranteed profitable ROI on all of their AI spend, all of their research, all their infrastructure, all their GPUs, they have highly, highly profitable ways to put it to work today.

It is a nice to have for Meta if the next form factor of computing is an AI assistant like Meta AI, but it''s not essential.

That''s one of many things that they could do profitably with AI technology.

Yep.

The other thing you got to remember is 2012 Facebook.

Look, their engineering brand still wasn''t top notch.

Like everyone knew that they were a up-and-coming, great startup that went public.

But they weren''t necessarily reputable in the computer science community as these people are Microsoft level researchers to advance the state of the art.

Or Google level in the way that Google always was from the beginning.

Yes, and I think Mark and Shrepp had to make this point to Jan, and then when Jan joined, it kind of made the point to the rest of the industry that this is not something that''s going to like wax and wane with our financial results were in for a decade on this particular area of research.

It''s kind of amazing.

It really only took like two years to bear fruit for them before they had profitably deployed AI systems in production, because most of the time these research projects take much, much longer.

It''s funny actually, thinking through this now, I think they''re three dimensions to the payoffs from this investment in AI and fair back in 2013.

One is the near term and immediately an ongoing profitable paybacks to incorporating AI in existing Facebook products and social media feed recommenders.

Highly, highly, highly profitable.

It just makes every ad that''s displayed more likely to make money and it makes every feed post that is displayed more likely to get engagement.

and yes, 100%.

Okay, then there''s two, which is this like, hey, AI might be the next computing platform.

There''s a lot of interesting stuff going on.

This allows us to have a piece on the chessboard and be a player in the next platform transition.

Should it be to AI?

And this is just like what Meta did with threads, with WhatsApp, you know, with threads, they''ve said we''re not monetizing it right now.

We''re gonna see if it becomes a big close to billion user platform.

And if it does, then great.

We''ll figure out the right monetization strategy, just like we did with WhatsApp.

It may or may not be ads specifically, but we build things that get engagement, and then we later figure out how to make money on them.

Yep.

And then three, they had no way of seeing this at the time.

But fair and AI actually becomes the way that they can catch up and re-architect to compete with TikTok via reels.

Yeah.

You know, no AI, no reels.

That''s such a good point.

If not for fair, TikTok could have disrupted Facebook.

Totally.

I mean, Reels would not have come out as fast as it did.

Right.

Facebook would not have had that near-term weapon to go, huh, we need something that kind of stops our users from leaking out and jumping over to this other app, you know, for a use case that we basically can''t match.

I mean, it is magic how the Reels and Tiktok algorithms work and now YouTube was short that very quickly they do figure out how to put things in front of you that are incredibly engaging just for you.

I mean, they call it the for you page.

And that have no social connection to you?

Yes, exactly.

You''re right.

The decision looks more pressing than ever given that.

Totally.

Okay, so that''s fair and AI.

Let''s jump forward now to 2016, 2017, 2018.

And I think for our purposes here today, it''s interesting to view the 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica, all the follow-up that comes out of that, which much, much, much ink has been spilled, through this lens of the consumer social transition from town square to living room.

Cause I think it actually explains a lot.

Oh, all right.

I''m curious to hear what you''re thinking here.

But to catch us up, here''s kind of what happened.

And until 2015ish, Facebook could kind of do no wrong, other than all the data privacy issues that they had sort of worked through with the FTC in 2011.

But they are now increasingly finding themselves in very controversial situations that they are ill prepared for as sort of all of humanity is now joining the network.

First of all, content moderation is becoming an issue.

Oh, yeah, for sure.

Facebook is trying to figure out their role in this.

Are they a neutral platform?

Do they need to kind of police what is said on their platform?

On top of that, actually defining what is allowable speech on their platform is becoming trickier than ever.

And it is hard to create one set of rules and abide by them globally.

And Facebook was just caught flat footed in a big way by the fire hose of questionable content that people would post.

Ultimately, they end up throwing huge amounts of people at this hiring tens of thousands of contractors to deal with content moderation, building out really sophisticated kind of policies and programs and escalation and review processes.

They have an ever escalating set of posts, videos and live streams shared around the platform.

That''s right, because it''s not just text anymore.

It''s obviously photos, but like videos now too.

Reviewing real-time video, absolutely.

And as you would imagine, they are not perfect at this.

So they''re creating headlines left and right about objectionable things being shared on the network.

In building technology that enables everyone around the world to communicate with each other and organize, they also have the flip side of anyone can share anything.

And if it''s engaging enough, there''s a ton of eyeballs that see it.

So misinformation is starting to become a big deal to ultimately, this comes to a head in the 2016 to 2018 period after they have whittled away.

a lot of the public''s goodwill, and we''re just gonna zoom in on this moment for the company.

The 2016 election happens, and a lot of people are looking around for an answer to, wait a minute.

Yeah, this isn''t the outcome that I expected.

What happened?

Exactly.

There''s a lot of people who feel this couldn''t have happened on its own legitimately, somebody did something.

And one thing that absolutely did happen is there was a firm called Cambridge Analytica that sold their services to the Trump campaign and had a methodology to create psychographic profiles that they believed would work that were derived from a Facebook quiz application.

This ends up being an absolute honey pot of a story for anyone who has fired up about a big change to the country that they are not excited about.

Yep.

And so, there were basically four stories concurrently happening of how Facebook was involved in the election.

One, there was Russian interference.

Two, people are spinning up fake news sites, not necessarily for politics, but actually for the ad dollars generated on them.

Three, Cambridge Analytica.

Four, the Trump campaign may have been really good to using Facebook''s digital marketing tools.

Yes, I think that is like undeniably too.

Yeah, so there''s been years of investigation into each.

It seems like that last one is actually the biggest lever.

Yes, Russians did spin up fake pages and accounts with pretty modest spend.

And people absolutely spun up fake news sites and generated fake viral stories for politics and also profit.

Cambridge Analytica, yes, it was a thing, But they ended up with actually pretty crappy derivative data from a quiz, not the treasure trove of raw Facebook data on you and your friends that everyone feared.

But David, to your point, really what happened is the Trump 2016 campaign just actually took Meta platform seriously and got really, really good at using the tools.

Yeah.

Quite ironic in that Obama totally doubled down on Facebook as a strategy and used it to great effect to win the 2008 and 2012 elections.

Yes.

So as you can imagine, I''m preparing for this episode and I''m like, okay, I just heard Mark Zuckerberg say on another podcast by a great interview with Alex Heath at the verge after Meta Connect about this.

He dropped this line.

People thought that all this data had been taken and it had been used in this campaign and it turned out the data wasn''t and the data wasn''t even accessible to the developer.

So David, I''m listening to that And I stopped because I''m thinking, well, that''s not what anybody thinks because there was a ton of reporting on the fact that they did.

So what actually happened here?

So here are the chain of events.

Back in the 2010s, Facebook built the platform that we talked about that was incredibly permissive in the early days when you authed your profile against an app.

You gave it all of your profile data.

And in those earliest days, it could actually see your whole friend list too.

Facebook eventually made their API much more closed off, but it took a couple of years to do that.

Now, there was a terms of service that required app developers to delete any data they had after a period of time and only use it for very specific purposes.

But of course, Facebook couldn''t actually guarantee that people were complying with the terms of service.

It was just, you know, you are a breaching contract.

So at some point, a developer made an app that was a quiz.

Users could opt into taking that quiz, the quiz asked you questions, and by combining the answers to those questions with the profile data you authenticated from Facebook, that That app developer then tried to label you with a pretty basic psychographic profile, and then ultimately that derivative data, the labels of personality characteristics that were derived from Facebook data and your quiz answers, is what Cambridge Analytica had, as best I could tell.

So I read a good amount of the report that the UK government put out about this.

The conclusion was that the quiz was taken by 320,000 people since those people had access to friends, the total surface area was the public profile data of 87 million Facebook users.

They also found that Facebook had requested that Cambridge Analytica delete all the data, both the actual Facebook data and anything derived from the Facebook data back in 2015 before the election even started.

So it was, yes, true.

An application got access to Facebook data on a lot of users is also true that it violated terms of service to use that data for other purposes and they did not comply with a delete request or they may not have complied.

It''s kind of difficult to reconstruct.

On top of all this, it supposes that Cambridge Analytica''s method of taking these quiz answers and translating them into something that could impact voting worked, like it was effective.

And that''s pretty thin.

Right.

That''s kind of the most thin thing of all of it.

Right.

So here''s what the UK report concluded.

And this is in government speak.

So it''s all very hedged.

While the models showed some success and correctly predicting attributes on individuals whose data was used in the training of the model, the real world accuracy of these predictions, when used on individuals whose data had not been used in the generating of the models was likely much lower.

Through our analysis of internal company communications, the investigation identified there was a degree of skepticism within Cambridge Analytica as to the accuracy or the reliability of the processing being undertaken.

They''re appeared to be concerned internally about the external messaging when set against the reality of their processing.

So at the end of the day, the Cambridge Analytica thing in particular was kind of a nothing burger.

But that is not the story that gets told.

The UK regulator was given full access to this and it ended up being quite skeptical that the methodology even worked in the first place.

So they''ve got this like kind of crappy derivative data, not complying with terms of service requests to delete it, and the method may not actually work.

Now, this doesn''t exonerate Facebook in any way from what could have happened.

They had an incredible treasure trove of data that apps could slurp up in the early 2010s, but the actual narrative of Facebook data that Cambridge Analytica had impacted election results is like wildly oversold.

Yep, all that aside.

As we were waiting through all of this and trying to make sense of it and think about how we''re going to talk about this unacquired, there is such an enormous, enormous disconnect between reading what actually happened and then how people felt and what the like lived reality of the brand impact on Facebook was, which that was huge.

Yeah.

Nothing could have been huge.

To me, the story here is there sure was a lot of ill will and discontent with the Facebook brand that people were willing to dive in headfirst on.

It''s almost like Facebook isn''t guilty of whatever the heck people think happened with Cambridge Analytica all these years later.

But something is very, very wrong that like hundreds of millions of people believe that.

Yeah.

And it''s not just wrong with the system.

They definitely, in behaviors along the way, I managed to earn people''s distrust.

I think that''s the issue.

So let''s bring it back to my supposition here, which is that I actually think this paradigm shift that Mark identified from town square to living room was way more right and way more powerful than even he realized.

And this is one of the second order effects of it.

The quiz that was the app on Facebook, that happened way back in the early platform days.

is totally solidly in the town square days.

And then the election happened in 2016 when things are already starting to transition, what''s up exists, snap exists, snap has launched stories, Instagram has now copied snap and launched stories in that very same year.

Two more years go by, the Cambridge Analytica news doesn''t actually hit until 2018.

By 2018, we are solidly in the living room era.

So, all of the supposed real or imagined impacts of this Cambridge Analytica thing had their roots back in the town square era.

We''re now here in the living room era, and that is what people''s expectations are of Facebook, of social media, of everything that they are sharing in their lives.

And I think this is, to my mind, at least, where the disconnect is.

People''s expectations shifted.

But now, all of a sudden, all this stuff in the past becomes really, really relevant to the present.

And when you look back at the past through this lens of what the present is, you''re like, well, this is really effed up.

Like, how the hell did the company do this?

Right.

And, you know, the answer was they were trying desperately to grow.

They were trying to will a platform into existence.

Of course, the cultural norms were a little bit more permissive, but like the cultural norms were really never permissive to the point to say, sure, you should download and store a big JSON dump of my whole profile information and any pages that I like and anybody whose names I''ve connected with like that always was probably a little bit of an overstep but then once developers were able to do that and then violate terms of service and store it forever then it just kind of becomes this like ticking time bomb that''s out there exactly it''s like this weird temporal and cultural like mismatch of it all landing in 2018 when the world is a very very, very different place.

In part, you know, you can see why Facebook massively prefers the ad-base business model of, we never even expose any information to you, advertiser.

You target, and then we just deliver the ads.

You never get to know anything about who the users are on our platform.

We don''t sell data.

Like that is a true fact whenever they stand up there and say, we don''t sell data.

They don''t.

They sell the opportunity to target users, but in fact, if they did sell data, it would be a bad thing because someone that could then build a competitor.

Like the asset that they have is actually their data that they choose not to sell four business reasons.

Yep, totally.

Then there''s this whole other layer to here of like, well, why did they do this in the first place?

Why did developers have access to so much data?

They were building platform.

They were building an entirely different business with a different strategy.

Now they are an advertising and media-based business.

We''re almost talking about two totally different companies here as I think we''ve told in the story.

Yeah, I do think when I search my heart of hearts, though, when I was developing apps in the 2010 period and would let people use Facebook Connect or whatever the current branding of accessing Facebook accounts was at the time, I was always like, whoa, this is a lot of data that comes with someone clicking that button.

Well, I think you made the point right of like, Facebook had to kind of sell the platform to developers.

Totally did.

They didn''t have the underlying hardware and technology and operating system to offer.

So there had to be a really big sweetener.

Yep.

I just can''t believe it though.

After all these years and all this writing and all these headlines, if Cambridge Analytica were more competent, they probably could have had more impact.

But as it stands, I just can''t believe there''s not a big story on the front page of major newspapers with big headlines saying, actually, Cambridge Analytica didn''t really have that much in the first place.

Their methodology appears to have not worked, and Mayacolpa, sorry for getting y''all all riled up.

If you don''t want to like Facebook, sure, but go pick a different reason.

Okay.

So what happened with all this?

It is worth knowing to finish the story earlier from the consent decree in 2011 that said Facebook is going to be carefully monitored for privacy concerns.

As you can imagine, the Cambridge Analytica News coming out, put a gigantic bullseye on Facebook, and the FTC said, aha, you guys signed a consent decree a mere seven years ago, what the hell?

This is exactly what we''re talking about.

And Facebook just decides, you know what, what''s the big dollar sign that we can check that we can write here?

Because it seems like we just want this to be done, we want this to be buried.

We''re a different company now, we kind of want to put that to bed.

The whole settlement here was not specifically about Cambridge Analytica.

There were a bunch of other things that are privacy related, but the number is $5 billion.

And, David, there is one thing that it comes with.

And that is a 20-year window that they are monitoring Facebook.

And that is exactly matching to the words that Mark gave us on stage that Cambridge Analytica, the way they handled it was a 20 year mistake.

Yep.

Now, I think by the 20 year mistake he met much more of like the damage to Facebook''s brand.

Yes.

That came out of this.

Yes.

And specifically the FTC settlement.

Yep.

It is funny.

I was thinking this is a very Facebook appropriate comment.

If we had sub titles for this episode, this one would be it''s complicated.

I guess so great.

It really is.

It really is.

It really is.

And what it comes down to is I think there is an ethos at Facebook that at many steps along the way, there was an opportunity to grow, to win, to compete.

And what mattered was winning and then when the dust settles, you can kind of look around and say, okay, what was the impact of that?

That is one way to run a company.

The other way is to be really careful and ask permission.

Facebook fell into the first camp and they probably wouldn''t be here today or certainly at least wouldn''t be a global player with four billion users today if they hadn''t fallen into the first camp.

But by falling into that first camp, you have stuff that comes up where you''re like, ah crap, I wish we hadn''t done that.

And this is one of them.

Right.

The time bombs totally.

Okay.

So what actually happens?

Facebook becomes a lot less valuable after all of this comes out.

The company announces in their July 2018 earnings call that they''re going to be more focused on user privacy and that revenue may slow as they make this intense focus.

They dropped 19% in one day.

They wiped out $119 billion in market value, which was the largest single day loss for any company in history at that time.

At that time.

Save at that time.

Yeah.

To be exceeded in the future.

So this whole privacy issue, the $5 billion settlement, all this stuff that just happens with Meta, it has big ripples for the whole tech industry.

There''s a phrase that is known on the lips of every American, somewhere in the neighborhood of Cambridge Analytica, election interference, fake news, I hate social media, Facebook did this, YouTube did that, blah, blah.

And this is a persistent drumbeat that is underneath the whole national discourse.

There is an opportunity to be the anti-Facebook here, if you want to be, to be the company that says we are so unbelievably incredibly about privacy, even more than we ever have been before.

David, who does that?

That is Tim Cook''s Apple.

Yes.

So Apple, a company that I love in a door and was actually wearing an Apple T-shirt earlier today and had to take it off before recording, because I felt like it was weird to be wearing my Apple T-shirt when recording the Facebook episode.

Apple is a company that has always been incredibly privacy conscious.

They both use that as something they believe deeply in their soul and design into their products and is amazing for all of us who use their products to get that privacy and have that trust.

They also, to use Ben Thompson''s parlance, use it as a strategy credit.

There are areas in which it really behooves them because they don''t need to do server side stuff.

They don''t need to do advertising because they make a lot of advertising indirectly from Google and they don''t need to do a lot of other things.

So they can tout.

Hey, we''re unbelievably secure with your data.

We take privacy incredibly seriously.

No one takes it more seriously than us.

They start really beating this drum and by 2021, they decide, you know what?

In iOS 14.6, we are going to launch a new policy called app tracking transparency.

Yep, ATT.

And what that means is a few years ago, we mandated that anybody who is tracking you across apps start using something called the IDFA, the identifier for advertisers.

Now in the past, Apple had let you just actually reach in and grab the device''s unique identifier, which was pretty cool because as a developer, it was unrelated to advertising.

Think of it almost like a serial number of this device.

And you could use that for things like, hey, is this the same user across multiple applications?

I''ve got my SDK and my code running in multiple developers'' applications, so I can do interesting things like say, hey, this person both takes runs with Strava, and they also use Google Maps, and you can just kind of gather data across apps.

Kind of similar to how Facebook was gathering across the web with like buttons everywhere, or with Facebook connect everywhere, so they could build this holistic profile of things you do off of Facebook.

So Apple stops letting you use the device identifier, they force you into using this IDFA.

And then with iOS 14.6 in 2021, they say, hey, if you''re using IDFA, part of that API is that now whenever someone launches an app for the first time, it''s going to ask them in this really aggressive language, are you okay with getting tracked?

Or do you want to ask this app not to track?

What do you think people are going to click?

Yeah.

There''s a default answer to that question.

Yes.

So what actually ends up happening, most people click ask app not to track a whole lot of Facebook''s targeting basically falls apart.

They no longer have a picture of you outside of apps that they actually own.

And a lot of the reason why advertisers can get so good at targeting is because of this holistic picture that is built for you across your phone.

David, this is the example kind of manifest in practice of the thing you were talking about all the way at the launch of mobile of what''s one of the reasons why Facebook''s beautifully constructed business model doesn''t work in the mobile walled garden ecosystem.

It''s because the operating system maker can make a change like this that just kind of affects core functionality that you were relying on.

Now you don''t have access to that data so you can''t run as effective of an advertising service.

Totally.

And a minute ago when you asked the question of who is banging the privacy drum, and I said, it''s Tim Cook''s apple.

One of the reasons I said that is that, actually, I didn''t know this till doing the research, Mark and Steve Jobs had a great relationship, which makes this story all that much more interesting.

Mark is very Steve-like.

Very, very Steve-like, and they actually met for the first time in 2007.

Right as all of this is coming together, and the first meeting was that Steve actually reached out to Mark and wanted to meet him and build a relationship, which I don''t think Steve did that with too many people.

And then so on the back of that, the next year in 2008, when the iPhone SDK was launching and people were building apps, Mark and Facebook actually go to Apple and meet with Steve and they pitch Steve on exactly what you were just talking about then like, hey, how about you let us bring our platform that we''ve just built that has all these developers into you iOS into your platform.

Really, oh, to make Facebook platform part of the iOS developer, whoa.

Yes, which, you know, from Facebook''s part is kind of like a Hail Mary.

Like, yeah, they''re probably not gonna say yes here, but this is really big risk to us.

We might as well try.

But they did have enough of a relationship where Facebook and Twitter both were privileged citizens on an early version of the iPhone OS.

Like in the settings screen, even before you installed any apps, there was like a Facebook and a Twitter settings for, I guess, like, native integration between the operating system and those networks.

And social networks, yes, totally.

So Steve, supposedly the legend goes, you know, Mark and the Facebook team make this whole pitch and at the end of it, Steve just looks at Mark and it''s, you know, like, all of us a little sheepish and it''s just like, thank you for, we''re just not going to let somebody else build a platform on top of our platform.

And then he sort of pushes back in his chair and it''s like, clear that''s the end.

And then he''s like, hey, so by the way, what do you guys think about Microsoft and working with them?

And then they just like have a really nice conversation supposedly for the next couple of hours and shoot the shit and talk about Microsoft and computing history.

It''s this very cordial relationship.

And I think the sense I get is that Steve really liked Mark and respected him.

Well, they''re both like pretty product visionaries and they''re both like very stubborn about their views of the future and they both were very right about their views of the future.

I can see it.

Totally.

And clearly, that is not the feeling today between the two companies.

And I think what happened since, okay, if it had just ended, Apple isn''t going to let Facebook build a platform on top of their platform, that might have been it.

But then when mobile app installs happened, and Facebook all of a sudden...

Facebook was making billions of dollars off of deciding what apps in the App Store get downloaded.

Apple had to have felt like, hey, this is actually...

this is our tariff ours.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And so then after everything that happened in 2016, 2018, Cambridge Analytica privacy, tier point, and part of this is that Apple has always cared about privacy and it''s always worked well for them and it''s part of their main product strategy.

Part of it too is like, oh great.

Here is kind of the ultimate competitive vector that we can have against somebody we really don''t like who we feel has profited off of our platform unfairly.

Yeah, you end up with Apple feeling like everything that happens on our platforms is ours.

And these are our users to protect.

And no one''s going to do wrong by our users in any way.

So you have Apple who is protective as all hell.

And then you have Facebook where Mark Zuckerberg, more than anything in the world, wants as much freedom to operate as possible.

And you have Apple trying to constrain and you have Mark who hates feeling held captive.

Yep.

So now here we are in 2021 and Apple''s like, we''re making our move.

Yeah.

Facebook''s been reeling.

We''ve been beating the privacy jump for the last couple of years since 2018 and Cambridge analytic.

Now it''s time to make the move.

So what ends up happening?

Actually the first couple of quarters, not much.

Facebook''s talking about our earnings calls, hey, we think this is going to have impact.

It''s not huge.

But then, February 2022, which is technically the end of year 2021 earnings call for Meta, they drop the bomb, interestingly in question and answer.

I listen to the whole earnings call and the CFO kind of casually says in a response to someone, oh, we think that the impact from ATT to our ad business will end up costing us on the order of $10 billion for 2022.

What?

That is eye popping.

like, uh, okay.

So what ends up happening is there''s a 26% drawdown in a single day.

Remember we said to put a pit in the, uh, single day drawdown records.

The market cap went from 900 billion to 700 billion.

The actual number is they lost 232 billion in market cap.

The new largest in history is surpassing their previous record.

And also, on this call, they announced their first ever quarter over quarter user decline.

Keep in mind what''s happening is on top of meta basically saturating most of the internet connected world by this point, TikTok is also really, really peaking.

So we''ve had some marginal users kind of using the app less because they''re moving to TikTok.

And Facebook is reacting to TikTok and trying to put reels in so they''re cannibalizing their own revenue by encouraging people to watch these short form AI recommended videos that actually don''t yet monetize as well as the newsfeed.

There''s just kind of three fronts that are destroying them here.

There''s ATT, there''s TikTok competition, and they''re making revenue cannibalizing changes in their own app.

So the hit continues.

It traded all the way down 46% by April 27th.

And then ultimately, it bottomed on Halloween that year.

So this is what eight months later, with a 72% drawdown.

Ooh.

They lost 72% of their value between February and Halloween.

Ooh, all in the year 2022.

It''s crazy.

And that is like Nvidia levels of drawdown back in the crazy Nvidia journey that we talked about.

It''s totally insane.

The interesting thing is, at this time, the real threat wasn''t actually ATT.

The biggest of those three threats was TikTok stealing users.

Yes.

The whole ATT thing is about how much money can we make off of an ad because it is so well-targeted.

It''s an optimization that is useless if you do not have users to advertise to in the first place.

Yes.

So the actual real existential threat is TikTok, and Ben Thompson makes this really great point, and I know I''ve quoted Ben over and over this episode, but I think he''s just been so astute on Facebook at many points throughout history.

This decision to make these product changes to respond to the TikTok threat in the face of ATT to do these at the same time is a founder-led decision.

If you had a professional CEO, the correct thing to do to preserve your job and shareholder value is to wait 6, 12 months before you start reacting to TikTok to let the whole ATT thing blow over.

Mark''s like, I can''t get fired.

I think the right thing to do is react to TikTok now because every day this problem compounds and gets absolutely worse.

I don''t care that there''s this horrible narrative going on right now with ATT that is going to cause us apparently to lose $10 billion of revenue.

We otherwise would have gotten this year.

We must cannibalize revenue you in addition to that to make these product changes.

What it ends up with is a 72% drawdown and what it also ends up with is the chance for it to 5x from there, which is what has happened.

The company saved itself by acting correctly in this and they had to go through this wild tumultuous two-year journey in the process.

It''s just another episode of Mark making these sets of decisions because he''s Mark because he controls the company and because he has the stomach to withstand it.

Yeah.

And what ended up actually happening from ATT?

It''s been value-destructive overall, because I don''t think the amount of money that has shifted away from Facebook has been captured by Apple.

I get the sense that the App install business for the App Store, those search ads is going great, but it''s not like equivalent to what the monetization over at Meta is on App install ads or was on App install ads?

Yeah.

I think Apple was sort of hoping in its heart of hearts that this would shift a lot of those dollars into ads in the App Store.

And the reality is people just don''t go to the App Store searching for apps anymore.

Not to mention this kneecapped meta on a lot of ads that are not App install ads.

This kneecapped a lot of the like we have a friend that''s in the retail business who was saying that their ads doubled in price in 2022 when this happened and they were sort of scratching their head and they have nothing to do with the App Store.

So all that kind of happened is that entrepreneur said, I guess I''m gonna keep advertising on Facebook as a platform, I hope it gets better.

I''ll pick some other platforms, but like I can''t advertise with Apple.

There''s nothing for me to do.

It''s a retail good, it''s a physical item.

So I guess I''ll just pay more money to acquire customers now.

Like an ends up actually hurting the business when go to market channels get less efficient unless you can sort of shift that spend to a place where your customer is also hanging out.

Yep.

In practice, Meta''s fine.

When a shift like this happens, the most scale player with the most engineers and the most data turns out they''re still the winner.

Meta launched this thing called Advantage Plus and now if you''re an advertiser, they use a whole bunch of other data signals and you still have a customer acquisition budget, you''re going to spend it.

You''re probably going to go spend it on Meta the same where you were before.

It''s just not quite as efficient as it was.

Oh, and by the way, anyone else that got hurt from the changes with ATT just doesn''t have the ability to react and build around it the way that Meta had because they don''t have the resources Meta does.

Yep.

So all of this finally brings us to the last piece of the story here that I''m sure listeners at this point you''re probably saying like what the heck or however many hours in you guys haven''t said the words reality labs or Oculus or AR or VR once oh is Facebook in that industry yeah yeah you know I guess they We are.

All right, so what happened here?

Way back in 2012, Facebook starts getting interested around the same time that they''re starting fair for AI and what is the platform of the future?

They start doing some hardware prototyping on their own.

They''re not really set up for that yet, but they do wanna do the same sort of approach that they did with AI, which is focused research, not general research, pick a particular thing where we have an opinion about something we think is gonna be the future and then invest deeply in it.

Yep.

So a crazy thing happened in February of 2014, they opened up the purse strings and paid $19 billion for WhatsApp.

They had so much conviction that the future was AR and VR that 34 days later, they paid another $2 billion for Oculus.

I had no recollection that these things were a month apart.

No, I didn''t.

I knew they were both in 2014, but I didn''t realize they were a month apart.

It''s wild.

I think Mark got the demo of Oculus and was just like, oh, this has the most credible potential to be the future out of anything that I''ve ever tried.

So yes.

But I think actually the right way to think about this is through the same lens as fair.

It''s a research lab in the same way that fair as a research lab.

And it was like, oh great, $2 billion to kickstart the research lab.

Fantastic.

All right.

So you and I have both tried Orion.

It is unbelievable, fantastic, very clearly a path to the next generation of computing device.

I don''t know if this is going to be the winning company.

I don''t know if that''s going to be the exact winning device.

But like, never have I been so sure that a mainframe very far away from me to converting to a PC which lives three feet from me, converting to a phone that lives in arms length from me.

the next logical step is glasses that live on my face.

And I used to sound ridiculous, and then you and I tried Orion, and now I''m like, oh, yep, that is going to replace or augment my phone in whenever these things are commercially available and consumer grade.

I''m glad we waited to do this episode because I think I would have had a pretty different take having only tried VR headsets and Vision Pro and big goggly things over the years.

I think I would have been unconvinced, And frankly, because I didn''t think it was possible to put something in that small of a form factor.

So that is the current product experience that you and I have recently had.

Now let''s look at the business strategy and the financials of how we have gotten here and why.

So there are two ways to look at reality labs.

The first way is to answer the question, what would have to be true about the business to be great on its own and justify all this investment?

And let''s level said on how much investment has gone into it.

Yes.

So based on their spend already, since they started reporting reality labs as a separate segment in 2019, they''ve spent right around $60 billion.

That is in operating losses for the segment.

And does that include the $2 billion for Oculus or, I mean, either way, it''s a rounding error.

Who cares?

I don''t think it does.

With that level of investment, it already needs to be essentially the most successful and profitable consumer product in history to pay itself back.

That is the only possible outcome here where we even get our money back.

I know this sounds wild, but like that is the bet no other outcomes are acceptable.

Fortunately, if we want to model this out, we know the financials of a product like that, the most successful and profitable consumer product in history, the iPhone.

So, as a thought experiment, what if Meta managed to launch such a product, say the Orion glasses tomorrow, and say that such a product grew at the exact same rate and with the exact same profit stream as the iPhone?

Well, I did that napkin math, and if 2024 this year was Apple''s 2007, so you just take all the iPhones cash flows and you start the clock right now, Meta''s cumulative cash flows from reality labs, would be net negative until at least 2035.

Okay, okay.

So we''re talking in 11 years.

You would get back to break even on your investment 11 years from now.

If starting tomorrow, they manage to create the most profitable and widely adopted product in human history.

Which obviously is not happening tomorrow.

That also assumes generously that Meta could build a services business attached to it the size of Apple''s services business, which probably generates right around an equal amount of profit.

So basically, take all the profits from iPhone and double it.

That''s actually what you would need.

It''s actually fair to attach a similar size services business.

I think that''s very fair knowing Meta and all of its capabilities and everything that we just talked about.

Yes.

That is the bet.

Let''s just be super clear.

Anything else is a complete incineration of cash.

Well, okay.

That is the bet looking it through the lens that you posited of a purely financial investment perspective.

The second way is actually kind of financial too.

I think there''s probably a third more emotional way.

The second way though is if you''re Mark and you constantly live under the thumb of platform control, you do almost anything to get out of it.

That''s not irrational.

I mean, Apple made a $10 billion dent in their revenue just two years ago with ATT.

And I mean, they could, I don''t think they would, but they could at any given moment just pull you out of the app store and you''d have little recourse.

That is a existential business risk.

And it''s an unlikely one, but every day you could wake up and all of your access to all Apple customers could be over.

Which by the way, we haven''t talked about it, but Google could do the same thing.

Google could totally do the same thing.

They have the right to distribute or not distribute.

Anyone''s app in their store at any given time and look at Apple and Epic with Fortnite.

Totally.

So there is actually an expected value calculation you can run, which is my entire company''s market cap times the likelihood that it could happen, which, you know, it''s extremely low likelihood, but because the market cap is $1.5 trillion, the expected value is still a very big number.

So then if you''re thinking this way, what is a reasonable percent of your market cap to invest every year in a hedge, that might, might get you out from under the thumb of big tech platforms.

And at meta being worth 1.5 trillion, if they''re spending 15, 20 billion a year on reality labs losses, that''s a little over 1%.

Right.

Is that worth it?

If you truly believe that this is the most effective way to offset your most existential risk in the next two decades, It''s, hell yeah, it is.

Hell yeah, it is.

Now, am I certain that this is the best way to hedge that risk?

No, I don''t know.

And like, is there a huge amount of execution risk along the way?

Well, they''re running many hedges on this, of course.

I mean, this is part of what fair is.

This is what Lama is, et cetera, et cetera.

But it''s a 1% tax on your, I mean, it''s generous to frame it off of market cap.

You probably should frame it off of revenue.

But still, a 1% tax off of your entire enterprise value every year, eh?

I think there is also potentially a third way to frame it, and it''s funny.

I think you put it in the emotional lens.

I actually think less emotional, but more upside oriented of Facebook did have the taste of being a platform for those couple of years there from 2007 to call it 2010, 2011.

And if they own the next platform, not only will they do everything that you''re just talking about of like, oh, they''ll have an iPhone size business because if it turns in to be glasses and reality labs, they''re going to be selling the hardware and maybe they can make that profitable, like the iPhone is profitable, et cetera, et cetera.

Then there''s also your point number two, which is like, this is a defensive play.

Our core business right now is at risk because it''s built on somebody else''s platform and Mark made the comment on stage with us that they''ve run the analysis.

They think they could be twice as profitable in their core media products if they were on their own platform.

Sure, great.

But then there''s like the big, big play is the third part of like, well, what if we actually built a platform again where we have millions of developers who are developing on us and we are participating in their business in the way that we used to participate when they were developing on us in the past?

That''s an even bigger play.

And to underscore your point, David, just a few weeks before we recorded this episode, Meta held a multi-hour keynote at Connect in September 2024.

And of those multiple hours, zero minutes were dedicated to their core products of social media apps, their $100 billion business of selling advertisements on these social media products.

So at least with developers, it''s not about any of that at all.

literally the entire keynote.

Yeah, I did.

It''s great.

It''s MetaAI, it''s the Lama models underneath it, it''s the open source strategy, it''s developers building for the quest, it''s announcing new products, like the next iteration of the Reban Meta glasses, it''s revealing Orion, zero minutes to their current products or business, and they''re one of the biggest businesses in the world.

Yeah, wild, right?

They are all about this platform future.

So here we are trying to make the case of like they did it, they decided they were an ads business and they built one of the two greatest advertising systems ever known to man and one of the most amazing business models ever and At their annual developer keynote.

They''re talking about how they''re going to one day become a platform company There we have it That is the story of meta.

I should probably say for a minute here too my experience using Orion, you were talking about yours a minute ago, I thought it was unbelievably compelling and before trying it, I never would have believed that any type of AR or VR would really have been the platform of the future.

And then after trying Orion, I was like, oh, yeah, I could replace a lot of what I do on the phone with just these lenses being in front of me all the time and it would be way more efficient and way more enjoyable.

I would never have guessed that in this year you could fit that into glasses.

Glasses and a wireless puck.

Totally.

Yeah, listeners we never shared our impressions on this.

It is wildly compelling and if you asked Mark, he probably would frame this whole thing differently than we have.

It''s not about this hedge and he would say some things about platform control.

But I think for him is just this general belief that we want to make awesome products.

And I believe there''s an awesome product to be made here.

And I''m going to assemble the best people I can to go work on it.

And I think that''s the like most interesting duality of this company is it''s both.

It''s what is the best strategic move to make to Marshall Y resources.

And a much more touchy feeling like I want to make products that are great and bring people closer together, because that''s the mission of the company.

Yep.

Well, well put, should we wrap the story there?

We should.

All right.

So we will catch you up on the business today, just to put some numbers to all of this, and then we will move into analysis.

So as of the end of reporting last quarter, there are 3.3 billion daily active people across the whole family of apps.

Okay.

Estonishing.

That''s up 7% year over year.

The family of apps revenue per person is about $12.

The end of year stats from last year when you just look at the Facebook app, not the whole family of apps.

The daily active users are 2.1 billion.

So of those 3.3 billion daily active people across all the apps, 2.1 billion are on Facebook.

book.

And the monthly number of Facebook is 3.1 billion monthly active users.

So 2.1 daily 3.1 monthly.

Wow.

What''s happened in Instagram are in the neighborhood of 2 billion monthly active users.

What''s app has a hundred million now in the US, which this is sort of a big narrative violation that what''s Apple never catch on in the US and nine messages dominant and even after that, it''s, you know, text message.

This is crazy.

100 million people a month in the US use WhatsApp now.

I mean, it''s been a slow burn over time, growing and growing and growing, but to me that kind of came out of nowhere.

The other narrative violation here, there actually is a lot of growth among young adults using the Facebook app itself in the US.

I think a lot of people think that''s a sort of boomer thing.

It''s funny.

One thing that may be contributing to that, which we didn''t put in the stories marketplace.

I mean, for me personally, Oh yeah, I have totally boomeranged all the way back around on the Facebook blue app and I am now a loyal DAU Because of marketplace.

It''s awesome Which is crazy because you don''t use any other form of Social media besides like posting on Twitter for acquired right correct They''ve announced that meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant by the end of the year It''s worth disambiguating meta AI from llama llama is the name of their family of open source models Those models do power meta AI, but meta AI itself is a branded consumer experience that lives both standalone and in a bunch of meta''s apps.

Their revenue in 2023 at the end of the year was $135 billion, operating income of $47 billion.

So that''s a 35% operating margin worth knowing, just like all tech companies, they have become CapEx heavy the last few years.

They now last year spent $28 billion in CapEx, which you should mostly read as data centers.

They operate a hyperscaler-sized data center footprint give or take.

You know, you think AWS, Azure, Microsoft, and Google Cloud.

Meta is the fourth one.

They just don''t sell it to anyone else.

It''s only consumed by internal teams.

So huge amounts of investment in AI hardware and just other data center expansion.

The balance sheet is fortress.

They have 50 billion in cash and 58 billion, including cash equivalents and marketable securities.

They have 71,000 employees and their market cap is 1.5 trillion up from 230 billion in just October of 22.

Wow.

Incredible.

Totally incredible.

So two really insane observations about the state of the company today.

All of their products seem to increase user engagement over time.

And all of these products have different use cases.

And it happens across geographies.

There is something in the water at this company.

Why is it that WhatsApp and Instagram are both increasing in user engagement over time.

It''s the growth function.

I mean, it''s this like purpose built heat seeking missile of attention and metrics that the company pays attention to, where across a whole broad product suite, engagement increases.

It''s not like they have one thing that happens to do really well.

It''s a process.

I would say it''s a whole set of things as these, you know, the company calls them centers of excellence internally.

It''s the growth function.

and it''s AI, it''s the ads and the revenue team.

All of this contributes to it.

Yep, fair.

The second insane thing at IPO, the US and Canada market had an average revenue per user of $11.

That number is now $227.

Wow.

Yeah.

And globally that average revenue per user, when you include all the emerging markets and less valuable markets for them is $44.

dollars, so they really, really monetize now.

So how much of the world does Meta really have left to kind of put a bookend on this?

I almost asked you this question all the way in the beginning when you were teeing up the episode, but I''m glad we''ll save it for here.

So according to the UN, last year there were 5.4 billion people online.

This includes China.

Right.

So they''re basically saying two thirds of humans are online.

And Metta does not include China.

Yes.

Metta has four billion monthly active people across the family of apps.

China alone is 1.4 billion.

And while this isn''t like totally exact, I think you just apply the same multiple to China and say, well, two thirds of humans are online, two thirds of China is online.

So that means that there''s 940 million people online in China.

I mean, that''s probably being conservative.

I think you could probably argue a much higher percentage of China is online.

Yeah.

But let''s be conservative.

That leaves about 450 million people, or 6% of the human population who have access to the internet, but are not yet metta monthly active.

That doesn''t mean they''re not metta users, that just means they weren''t monthly active users as of the end of the last reporting period.

So metta''s addressable users who aren''t yet users is less than 6% of humans.

to the wild, to the wild, and then still I think the craziest thing about the company is that if you look at the daily active user figure, it''s not that much lower.

Right.

And across all products.

And so once you frame it this way and you''re like, huh, there''s only 6% of the population left either through reactivation or signing up that they could get.

You sort of understand why they put so much effort behind emerging markets, It''s behind doing things like zero rating, doing custom deals with telcos, rolling out fiber, bringing countries online for the first time, even when they have no near term monetization potential, internet.org was the name of their initial for a long time around this to basically say, look, we are saturating humans, we gotta figure out how to get more humans on the internet.

Yep, move on to analysis.

Yep, okay, so in the analysis, the first thing we''re gonna do is power and then playbook.

So we are going to do a seven powers analysis of what enables Meta to achieve persistent differential returns or, you know, to put it another way to be more profitable than their closest competitor and do so sustainably.

This is interesting.

Who is their closest competitor?

I think that''s probably worth defining first and foremost.

Ultimately, they are in the business of selling advertising.

So I think their closest competitor is Google.

Yeah, they are certainly the most similar looking businesses in their current forms.

But like, who do they compete against for the same profits or the same potential profits?

Right.

I''m not sure that it''s actually Google.

I mean, it almost certainly is YouTube within Google, but I actually think it is other social platforms.

Yeah, you''re right.

I suppose it''s other places people spend time.

Yeah, it''s where people spend their time.

Right.

online and offline.

Right.

And I think really what has to happen here is an analysis of each set of stakeholders individually.

Like you almost kind of want to do a seven powers analysis on the user side also of why would someone pick a meta product over a snap product.

And even though they''re not voting with dollars, it''s almost like their attention is a proxy for dollars because you just assume that those companies should do a comparable job monetizing the attention.

Yeah.

But what makes sense I think is to just walk through each of them.

So counter positioning, they probably don''t have much counter positioning in the current state of meta and hold on AI for the moment.

In their startup days, they did a lot of counter positioning against other global social networks.

By being a college only authenticated social network, they were accepting lower growth, they were accepting a cap ceiling of number of users, and they were doing that because they wanted to make the trade that they felt, you know, a closed community is more important.

Yeah.

With higher engagement, scale economies, scale economies, 100%, absolutely.

This company''s in the business of scale economies.

Yes.

And I think that scale economies on the infrastructure side, on the GPU investment side, I think that scale economies on the advertiser side and on the ad experience side, like just by having so much more scale, they are the default standard way to spend money for advertisers.

Think about on the tooling side.

Think about the experience of being an engineer at meta and the thousand engineer years of work that comes out of that company every year on making the developer experience of working there better.

I mean, it''s crazy with the revenue scale that they have, how much they can amortize these fixed costs.

Totally.

Everything at this company is scale economies.

Yes.

Okay, scale economies for sure.

Switching costs as a user.

You''re pretty locked in once you have followers.

Oh, I hadn''t thought about that.

Yeah, that really speaks to, again, you know, another shift we didn''t really talk about in the evolution of what we call social media is the creator aspect of all of this.

The whole idea of like a creator an influencer didn''t exist in the early days of social media and Facebook.

But now you and me, our platform on the podcasting platform, like we have a credible switching cost.

Somebody who has a ton of Instagram followers has incredible switching costs.

Yep.

Now, fortunately, in the land of creators, you don''t actually need to switch.

It''s just an end.

Yep.

You know, it''s not like you''re ripping out one vendor and putting another vendor in.

I do have a sunk cost in building a following on a given platform, but that doesn''t actually prevent me from also launching on another platform.

If you have the time to kind of do that.

Yep.

I think there might actually be process power.

Normally there''s not, but I keep kind of going back to this like there''s something in the water.

Their products grow in engagement over time.

Their growth team does 10,000 little things to open up every step of the funnel as wide as it can be and make the most frictionless fluid experience for users.

Interesting.

Yeah.

I was actually having this discussion with Hamilton and recently about the difference between process power and cornered resource, and a good test for this is when you bring somebody brand new into the organization and plug them in, does the power transfer to them as well?

If no, then it''s a cornered resource.

If yes, then it''s process power.

In this case, I think that''s potentially true.

Yeah, you can bring in new engineers, you can bring in new product people and transfer the advantage to them.

You know, for a while, they had legitimate process power in how they shipped.

I mean, Statsig has started on the premise of this.

It blew my mind when someone from Facebook came and gave a talk at Microsoft in 2014 on how they ship product and how it rolls out and not only the feature-flying elements of it, but they can sort of like watch performance, auto-roll things back if they''re causing a negative performance metrics.

how there''s just deployed code all the time with a whole bunch of experiments turned off, how there''s these experiments that are running in different ways in different markets, and they can statistically significantly disentangle which results are from which experiment when they have multiple experiments that are concurrently running with the same user base.

I mean, that was like real voodoo that only Facebook did for feels like a decade.

Yeah.

And I suppose Google probably does similar type things in different ways, but nobody else really does.

I think OpenAI kind of does.

I think OpenAI has so much former Facebook DNA and kind of thinks the same way that I think they do a lot of this sort of thing too.

Yeah.

Okay.

I can buy that there''s some process power here.

Yeah.

Branding.

Branding is such an interesting one.

I mean, can they have negative brand power?

Yeah, right, anti-power, branding weakness.

There''s no love for the brand meta.

There''s no love for the brand Facebook.

There is love for the brand Instagram.

Yeah, but diminishing as it gets larger.

Certainly not like it once was.

Yeah, there''s like reliability with it all.

Like I feel pretty, I mean, there''s branding that comes with being any big company that you''re sort of like large and trusted and institutional.

Yep.

But no, I think this is a clear example of how strong the other powers in this company are that, like, despite the brand taking a 20-year hit in Mark''s parlance, they''re still today, you know, one and a half trillion dollar company.

Yeah.

And then, cornered resource, unless you''re going to call Mark 1, which always feels a little bit too cute to name the founder.

I actually think there are some cornered resources here within Meta, and ironically, I think one of the biggest ones is the integrity and safety team and all of the privacy controls and work and security that they have done.

That they''ve had to harden over the years, yeah.

Yeah, even though this is also the source of so many criticisms about the company.

It''s now pretty robust.

If you think about anybody that would start up to try and compete with them, somebody I was talking to put this to me, like, imagine a startup trying to build a hate speech classifier in Farsi, Metta''s got that.

And trying to have the relationships with the public policy people in 200 countries to understand what is acceptable speech in each of those countries.

Yeah, so while probably, you know, YouTube to a certain extent TikTok, perhaps also have similar strengths here, I doubt there is any other company in the world capable of actually operating privacy, integrity, and security.

And within that is also anti-spam stuff too, which is super, super, super huge at the level that Facebook is.

Hmm.

It''s interesting.

Okay.

So in looking at this, why does Meta do $47 billion a year in operating income and why do we all believe that''s going to continue for a while?

Like what actually is the defensibility here?

Is it the network economies because they''re so tautological that I mean, I would argue it''s not that because what we''ve seen is TikTok showed us there''s a way without initial strong network effects to go capture people''s attention and thus eventually the add dollars.

Yes, and they competed very successfully with Meta in doing so.

Yeah, if this were five years ago, I would have been like, why even talk about the rest, network economies?

Once you have the network, then, you know, it doesn''t the rest doesn''t matter.

That''s just not true anymore.

Yeah.

Well, I think the network economies are still true relative to anybody who would compete in a social product, which still exists.

Totally.

Social is just now divorced from media.

Right, and most people do use both and sometimes they even use different apps for it But it''s two different modes of let me it may be the same session on the couch But you do need both use cases of show me who the people that I intentionally follow What they''re doing and then show me entertaining things.

Yeah So part of their business is defensible from the network economies But the other part honestly it kind of feels like habit Well, habit, but I think scale economies are really big for that too, especially in AI.

I think the only way that this new paradigm exists is because of AI and because of GPUs specifically.

And I''m not even talking about generative AI.

I''m talking about like feed recommender systems and personalization systems.

And so like there is a very, very large minimum barrier to entry there that keeps going higher as bite-dance and better keep investing in it.

Yep.

That''s a great point.

Okay.

Okay.

Playbook.

Playbook.

Let''s do it.

Okay.

So let''s talk about what Meta is doing with AI.

And that will lead us into our first playbook theme because we''ve talked about so far, the beginning of fair, them starting all this AI research, the early 2014 on use of feed recommenders and the AI for the ad matching system.

But there''s a lot going on with Facebook and AI right now that we really haven''t talked about.

So there are two words for you to know.

One is llama, and this is the family of foundational models that Meta has developed.

And these are competitive with open AI and Anthropics Claude and Google Gemini, etc.

Yeah, and then there''s Meta AI and Meta AI is a consumer brand that is the way that you interact with Meta''s self-hosted version of Lama or maybe give it a little bit more greens than that.

It is an application that Meta has that uses Lama in the background but provides Meta-specific AI experiences.

Some of them bundled into apps like in WhatsApp chat or in Instagram.

The blue app or whatever, yep.

Yeah, but also there''s a meta AI website that you can go to and interact with it directly.

But Lama is the models themselves, meta AI is the consumer product.

And Lama, they have spent billions and billions of dollars, huge amounts of R&D, huge GPU clusters to train big data centers.

Interestingly, it is all open source.

So Mark makes a big deal about this.

Yes, it''s interesting to sort of think about why.

It''s not open source in the same way, really, that Olinix is open source, and this is the free standard that everybody uses, and there''s just sort of a foundation behind it all.

Meta is putting huge amounts of capex and Opex, like huge amount of dollars, into willing llama into existence.

It''s very different than these sort of cheap grass roots, open source projects of the past.

Yeah, it''s open source like Android is open source.

Yes.

And so why are they doing this?

Well, if you ask Mark why they have an AI model at all and I''m quoting from a great blog post that he put out about this, we must ensure that we always have access to the best technology and that we''re not locking into a competitor''s closed ecosystem where they restrict what we build.

Okay, I understand that.

You believe that the most important thing is to to control the key technologies that make your products possible.

Okay, that last bit is important.

Basically, what Mark is saying here is, we''re gonna spend a lot of money training these foundational models, but unlike all of the competitors in the AI space, we actually don''t have a business model around making money on this.

So we''re gonna spend all the money, we''re gonna give it away for you, why does that make sense?

It''s open compute project all over again.

Yes, so for anybody who''s not familiar, Facebook made this move in the early 2010s where they realized they were spending tons and tons of money on their data center infrastructure.

And the vendors who they were paying these integration partners and the server companies and the networking companies were making fat margins.

And they were thinking, this is dumb.

We''re a really big customer.

Why is everybody else making so much money on us?

And they looked around and they saw all these other big data center companies and they''re like, Like geez, all those people are paying big margins too.

What if we just publish the specs for the billions of dollars of work that we have done to make our data centers?

And then we start this thing called the Open Compute Project.

And we just get a bunch of other people to adopt it too.

Well, suddenly, then the Open Compute Project is this standard by which all the hardware manufacturers and integrators actually have to snap to because all the customers are saying, this is what we want.

And it''s a pretty genius way to drive margins down for these suppliers.

And also a way to guard against somebody in your supply chain kind of building platform power.

Yes.

So what they basically learn from this is, oh, we open source this thing.

A lot of our costs went down because the whole ecosystem started using the thing that we open sourced.

So even though we''re not making money, you know, they''re not a cloud company, they''re not selling access to their data centers to anyone.

Right.

They''re not a hyperscaler.

It pays back in the form of saving them money.

It can do the same thing in AI.

They publish a really expensive open source foundational model that is in the conversation to be as good as these other closed source ones.

Well now, there''s a lot of developers out there who are just going to build on the open source free one.

It kind of becomes something that the community can build on and improve and make better.

As Mark said in our conversation with us on stage, there''s a lot more smart people outside your company than inside it.

But effectively what it does is it puts pricing pressure on the AI model companies.

To the extent that Mark views it as a super important key ingredient to the product experiences he wants to build in the future, it''s super bad if there''s a few close source providers who can provide that experience and they a lock him in to controlling, so here''s what you can build, here''s what you can''t build.

But B, take his margin, basically say it''s really expensive every time you want to make a call to one of our proprietary services.

When you think about it, it''s actually a form of operating leverage, where he''s basically saying there''s a big fixed cost I''m willing to bear in order to bootstrap this ecosystem and commoditize all of these compliments, commoditize all of these other closed source AI models, and in exchange what I''m going to get for that is just pricing pressure on all of them so that in the future, my variable costs are lower.

I just get to keep more of the dollars that we bring in rather than having to pay them out to proprietary model providers in the future.

It''s a pretty novel business strategy.

Yeah, totally.

So I said commoditize your compliments.

This notion was dreamed up and named by Joel Spolsky in 2002, where there''s a great blog post about it.

And he makes this analogy, think about cars and gasoline.

these are compliments.

When sales increase in one, sales increases in the other.

You have a car, you need gasoline.

Well, AI models end up being a compliment to Metas products in order for them to build better AI or even the feed recommendation stuff we talked about.

They need best-in-class AI models.

And just because cars increase the sales of gasoline, that doesn''t tell you about how profitable an automaker gets to be versus a gasoline maker.

So imagine the automaker decided that that they want to get into the gas business so that their customers could have access to low-cost gasoline or even further, let''s say the automaker decided to make low-cost gasoline just to drive all the other gasoline prices down while gas is cheaper and you''re the automaker, you can actually charge more for cars since consumer willingness to pay is around the total cost of ownership not about a car or gasoline specifically.

Right.

As a consumer, you''re always buying a solution.

You''re buying transportation or you''re buying a technology product doing a job for you, and if AI is a required input to that solution, then like, yeah, you''re thinking about that as a total purchase decision.

Yes.

Or an advertiser is not going to pay you more or less depending on how much you have to pay the AI model provider.

They''re going to pay you an amount, and if you want to maximize the amount of that you get to keep, it behooves you for you to not have to pay as much money to AI model providers.

years.

Yes.

Better put.

Okay, so how does this apply to playbook?

Well, Meta seems to like taking all the risk in situations like this, putting lots of dollars in so they can take more of the reward.

You can imagine a more moderate company saying, oh, well, there''s going to be lots of AI vendors out there.

And we could just let them take care of that as their core competency.

And we''ll just buy off the shelf from them.

But that''s not how MetaWorks, especially with everything they''ve been through with Apple, they have gotten true religion.

And I think always kind of wanted to be in this position and they just have the capital to do it now.

They will control the key technologies that matter to them, both for getting to own and dictate product roadmaps and products decisions, but also for the financial upside of making sure that they control their own destiny and no one in the ecosystem has extreme leverage over them.

Right.

Only a company of the scale of meta can kind of run this playbook, playbook in quotes, because no startup is going to be like, oh, okay, what is my strategy to make sure that OpenAI and Anthropic don''t get leverage over me.

Good luck with that.

Yep, totally.

So my first big playbook theme is meta discovers commoditize your complement and is now looking for ways to use it everywhere.

I love it.

Well, but okay.

Great.

I think my first one is almost a different way of putting that, which is really like Mark and specifically his superpower of placing multiple bets on multiple chessboards.

Never wanting to be backed into a corner.

And I think he has done incredibly well.

And I think the story of Meta shows all throughout, even in the very, very beginning as a tiny project, not even a startup where degrees of freedom were limited.

He was always making choices and playing the game such that there were multiple options of how things could go right.

Totally.

Mark is a master at maximizing his degrees of freedom and setting up the board such that in an uncertain future, there are multiple paths to victory no matter how the world unfolds.

Yep.

Which is unbelievably gatesian.

I feel like we said the exact same line about Bill Gates in our Microsoft episodes.

The real comp for this company is Microsoft.

I think that''s right.

That was actually my next one.

They do iterative product development.

They put the first version out just to kind of get feedback and see how they need to rev it and get better for the future.

The early days are characterized by hiring all the smartest people and prioritizing IQ over everything else, commoditizing your compliment, obsession with building a platform that other developers build on top of this whole thing about multiple bets in an uncertain future.

I mean, it''s funny that just look at they were building messenger internally, they bought WhatsApp.

I bet they''re glad that they had that dual prong strategy.

They were developing an app called Photos at the same time that they bought Instagram.

That''s what they do.

It''s Gatesian.

And the most interesting thing that I think is like hit me in the face like a ton of and the shift in public perception and having to do all this testifying is like watching an alternate future for Microsoft where Bill Gates had decided to stay at the helm instead of leaving after the DOJ case.

That is the biggest difference is they both went through this hellish period, and Mark came out of it and said, I''m more bought in than ever, and Bill came out of it and said, Steve, you''re the CEO now.

Yep, it''s exactly it.

Yep.

Are you going to talk about Mark''s amazing line from the Harvard CS50 lecture in like 2005?

I''m not, but lay it on me.

Oh, it''s so great.

Mark''s what?

20 years old at this point maybe.

He spent the summer out in Palo Alto.

He gets invited back to do a guest lecture as like a practitioner in the field at Harvard CS50 class.

And he''s talking about product strategy and he He talks about how he really admires Microsoft''s product strategy and he thinks it makes a lot of sense of the first version is getting something out there and it''s usually not very good, but by the third or fourth version, it''s pretty darn good and that makes a lot of sense to me as a good product strategy.

It is amazing.

He lays it out right there.

We don''t have to like speculate it is explicitly stated.

In the same vein, it is painfully obvious when you look at this company that companies are just founders extended.

The culture of this company is just Mark, and it''s a huge lever for Mark to act.

This has been true over and over again, Microsoft, Nvidia, Nike.

It''s just how great companies are in the world.

It''s very hard for me to point to a truly great company where the DNA isn''t like a lever on the founder''s personality.

I think that is right, and I think it is doubly so with Meta because of Sean Parker and because it was set up from the very, very beginning that nobody could ever get rid of Mark, that it was always going to be his decision.

And there''s got to be a lot of companies out there that like we''re looking at the success case.

Yeah, this works if the founder is really, really, really smart and right almost all of the time.

Right.

As we talk to people here are the traits that we heard over and over again, Mark is a genius, a really good listener, a fast learner.

He goes from knowing zero to mastery in months or years.

He has low ego about being right.

That''s not to say that he has a low ego, but he has a low ego about being right.

He is obsessed with finding truth and open to being wrong.

He''s intensely competitive, he''s relentless.

He''s actually a very good product designer and understanding the computer architecture that will be required to accomplish such a product experience at scale.

I mean, all these things like if you have these characteristics and you''re then empowered to singularly control the company at massive scale, yeah, it''s going to go well.

But the first thing is actually much harder than the second thing.

Yes, yes.

It''s not a causal relationship here that having founder control will lead to the right decisions.

Right.

This is my regular reminder that in studying these episodes with extreme survivor ship bias, we are looking at the most extreme outliers who in every dimension you could multiply by there at the edge of the distribution.

Mark is, I don''t know, six or seven standard deviations from the mean human across the important traits that mattered to making Facebook.

Oh, and by the way, with the right timing and the right luck and the right circumstance and the right know how my biggest lesson from doing acquired is these things are unrecreatable.

Yeah.

Agreed.

All right.

What''s your next one?

Durable executive team.

It''s kind of shocking how many of the people that are Mark''s direct reports and their directs have just been there for a really long time.

This team knows how to work together.

Oh, yes.

I was actually talking about this with one of the execs at Meta the other day and he brought this up and was saying that like this really feels like something very, very unique to Meta and I thought about it for a minute and I was like, actually, no, I think this is something that is unique to all great companies.

If you look across the landscape out there, Apple certainly like this.

If you look at Nvidia, if you look at Apple, If you look at, you know, Microsoft in recent years, if you look at the original Microsoft, you look at Costco, like this is almost always true, really is true in every great company that I can think of.

The core senior most executive team are all people who came up in the company or been there for a very, very long time.

It''s not a whole bunch of mercenaries there at the top.

Yeah, that''s interesting.

Okay, that brings me to this next one, which is something we talked a little bit about with Mark on stage.

I''m curious to hear your answer to this.

Now that we''ve had all this time and space to think about it.

Here are all the battles where meta has either one by buying the company, one by beating the company, one by copying or gotten to some kind of sustainable stalemate.

MySpace and Friendster, Google Plus, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp.

We didn''t talk about this one, but a mere cap and periscope.

Oh, yeah.

They launched Facebook live when that was supposed to be the next big thing.

Yep.

Snapchat and TikTok.

That''s like seven, eight.

Why do they keep winning?

I have some thoughts.

It''s funny.

As we were preparing to interview Mark at Chase Center last month, this was the question that we kept asking people.

Well, in some ways, I think it''s a little bit of a Rorschach test.

Everybody''s answer was different, and it was always like what they think is the most important thing.

I think my answer for this is going to be a version of Mark as the answer.

And it kind of goes back to Adam D''Angelo''s Friendster testimonial about him being way too lucky and then realizing it''s not luck at all.

And I think it is that, you know, as Adam was telling to me, as he''s reflected on this, it''s a very specific way of carrying yourself through the world where you don''t hold too tightly to the path you''re on.

Obviously Mark is incredibly driven to the goal of connecting all the people in the world and doing that through meta.

But he''s very, very open and flexible to like the exact path that it''s going to take to get there.

Yes.

And that combination, I think, has led over and over and over again to these threats emerging and Mark and the whole team there at meta saying like, okay, what is the way that we can neutralize this threat or defeat it?

And we are open to anything on that front.

And I think they are open to being whatever they need to be to make that happen.

I think Meta might look extremely different 20 years from now than it is today, almost like unrecognizably because this company moves like water in response to whatever the new shape of the world is.

I mean, hell, after trying Orion, I think there''s a very plausible reality five years from now where this company looks very, very different than it does today.

Yeah, I mean, it really is this idea.

Meta is a technology company through and through, and then they leverage that technology to be whatever the hell they need to be to adapt to the new world, which is so different from all of the other big technology companies out there.

They are all wedded to a particular vision of what they are.

Totally, because these are all different strengths, like they are in a freight of copying.

Okay, that is a strength, but that''s also a completely different thing than I''m going to place bets on what I think is going to be the big technology wave of the future and spend tens of billions of dollars on that.

That''s a different way of winning.

Or in some cases, I''m going to try to leverage my existing network effect to make sure I adopt someone else''s social mechanic.

Okay, that worked in a handful of these scenarios, but that''s not at all what works in others.

They don''t just have one singular playbook that they run over and over.

Right.

Right.

This company moves like water and product is an active discovery there.

I''m convinced it''s not pure invention.

You asked Mark that on stage.

And there''s some stuff they have to invent.

Like Orion, you have to invent.

But software where you can ship and quickly respond to user feedback and iterate, it''s like they''re chiseling away at the marble to find David.

I don''t think they have David in mind when they''re starting.

Most of the time, there are a few moments where they did.

Newsfeed is completely one of them.

Inventing the social feed is a completely distinct and brand new thing that Meta created.

It''s actually one of the few.

When I was a little bit more bearish on the future of reality labs, I was trying to come up with, has Meta ever successfully created something new that has become a profit center for them that is like not adopted from someone else?

Well, I think the tagging of photos was pretty novel.

Yes.

And newsfeed.

Yep.

But it''s like kind of funny that we''re naming those things as platform as short lived as it was.

No, that was a we wish we had an operating system, but we don''t.

So let''s see if we can convince people that this is a sufficient platform.

Well, I think building a real honest-to-god platform with hundreds of thousands, if not millions of developers, making money on it, on the open web.

Okay.

Fair pushback.

It was totally novel.

Like, nobody had done it without an operating system before, and like...

Maybe there was going to be a social platform in this new era.

Yeah.

Maybe that was an operating system of sorts, or on par with operating systems to be able to create a platform on top of.

But I take your point, it''s certainly not every turn of the game where they''re inventing.

They''re doing a lot of discovery here.

Right.

And maybe all companies do and, you know, there''s not something distinct to meta here and everybody learns from each other.

And that''s fine too.

But that was something that I was racking my head on thinking through.

In fact, there''s even a testimony, this is kind of funny, in the Mark Zuckerberg versus the Winklevoss case from way, way, way back one.

and Mark even makes some comment about, well, actually the idea for Facebook wasn''t even new because MySpace and Friendster existed.

So it''s like this interesting positioning of the whole thing itself is actually a borrowed idea, which of course served him well in that particular case.

But the point sort of stands is like, so much of this is borrowed, and we just live in a world especially in social where you do kind of have to just, maybe this is media as a whole, observe what the new format is and adopt it as quickly as possible.

Yeah, so speaking of trying things, I just wanted to take a moment to honor all the failures.

I kept a running list as I was doing my research on products that either died or just didn''t live up to the hype.

Facebook live, Facebook watch, the drone, the solar power drone that that they developed to provide internet access?

Oh, yeah, that''s right.

That was like a whole big thing for a while that, yeah, that''s right.

Mark was actually two for three on, he was forecasting like in 2015, what are we gonna be focused on 10 years from now?

That was one of them.

Or the other two were augmented reality and AI.

It was kind of an impressive call.

Portal, Portal TV workplace, which as far as I can tell, Facebook is the only company in the world that actually uses workplace, no other enterprises ever adopted it.

I''m sure that''s not like exactly true, but that feels approximately true.

Beacon, Facebook deals, which was their Groupon clone.

No, that''s right.

Think about how nimble Facebook is that they''re like, oh, oh, this social deals thing seems to be gaining traction.

Maybe that''s a core part of the platform that needs to be a piece of this in the future.

I mean, they just had zillions of these Facebook gifts.

You were gifting and you could use Facebook credits to pay for them.

Facebook book credits.

I mean, on top of Facebook credits, uh, Libre, oh boy.

Yeah.

Wow.

We didn''t even talk about that whole chapter on crypto.

Yeah.

They invented a whole new, you know, cryptocurrency and a big consortium around it and a huge set of investors and other Fortune 500s.

Originally, Facebook messages was going to be a Gmail killer.

You could email people into Facebook Messages and use that as an email suite, Facebook Places, when, I mean, four square was almost on par for a period of time with Instagram and Twitter as plausibly the next social mechanic checking in places.

And Facebook Places was a real effort.

Hey, now it just turns into tagging locations on posts, but like a first-class post in newsfeed for a while was a check-in on Facebook places.

Yep.

And then there''s all the independent apps.

Lasso, poke, slingshot, photos, hello, Facebook gaming, life stage, moments, notify, Facebook watch, moves, all the things they acquired, TBH, Beluga, they launched IGTV.

This company tries everything.

They move like water to discover what they need to be through an ever-changing environment.

So true.

All right, that''s it on the failures, what else you got?

Well, almost sort of the opposite of the failures, it''s quite ironic that Facebook became the prototypical startup, given that the goal was never to be a startup.

Yes.

The goal was first to be a project, and then to build a very profitable business.

The largest empire in the world, yes.

There was no in between of like, we are building a startup here.

It was like college project, oh, let''s connect all the people in the world and let''s get big really really really fast and skip this whole small company thing Right.

That''s such a good point.

And all this whole generation multiple generations now of startup founders that have really like Embraced and romanticized this whole startup thing on the one it like it''s great Silicon Valley so much bigger and there''s so much more investment and there''s so many more VCs and all that but it''s also just all kind of ironic that it''s glorifying this startup phase when that is not the point.

Deeply, okay.

So then we''ve touched on this one a bunch, but I kind of want to put a pin in it.

Why has Facebook always been in a precarious position?

Why do they need to keep fighting these existential battles?

Why are they so obsessed with building a platform?

I think the answer is they want to be as durable as a company that makes hardware with an operating system that all the users use and all the developers have to target because all the users are there.

I think that''s like what they really want, but because they''ve never had quite that much defensibility, you know, like, oh, a network effect is good, but it''s not as good as that incredible platform durability.

They''re always trying to expand and be more, every time they bump up against someone else, it kind of creates a problem for them.

And so I''m using a bunch of weird metaphors here, but it just seems like the place that they occupy in the technology stack is just not quite privileged enough to do the things that they want to do.

And so they''re always at the whim of someone else knocking them around.

Yeah, I think that''s right.

And it will be very interesting to revisit this again in five years or 10 years.

Yeah, part two and 10 years.

Yeah, right.

And then as we as we drift to a close here, where the engineering culture and being a technology company at their core has been essential.

Early on, they really did manage to hire only A-plus and then stay A-plus after that.

For ever and ever and ever, it was just this badge of honor if you were an engineer at Facebook for product design too.

I mean, they just had such a great talent density.

The set of things that they did on the technical side were over and over again a way to have their cake and eat it too.

If you can move faster, you can learn more through your multiple iterations.

And so speed of development comes from having great tools.

One very great, shiny example of this is something called hip hop for PHP.

Yep.

And this is very esoteric, but in the late 2000s, they had this crazy idea that what we should do instead of switching to C or C++ or Java, we want our engineers to keep writing PHP.

So they wrote a compiler to C.

So they didn''t have to take the performance hit from running PHP, which was an interpreted language.

But it also sculpted this like scalability problem because then they didn''t need to go hire all these systems level programmers.

They could hire web developers who wanted to move with that pace and flexibility while also having the infrastructure to run these massive systems and scale really efficiently.

And then that solved the scaling and performance problem.

But again, in 2014, they realized, oh crap, we''re big enough, and we don''t have enough sensitive data that we really should switch to a statically typed language, like Java or C sharp.

But again, they didn''t want to force their engineers to learn that.

They didn''t want to people who code in those languages have a different culture than existed at Facebook too They couldn''t really recruit people so they invented a new language called hack that was very similar to PHP But had static typing over and over again.

I mean Tao was another example this no-sequel database They just keep finding ways where they like invent new technology to solve a problem that probably only exists for them and then they create this like whole boutique system that allows a having one class talent, b, to have a ton of them, c, everyone gets to move fast, but then d, it''s all unbelievably performant and efficient and they just don''t have to make trade-offs.

It is wild.

Yep.

Okay.

Then my second technical one in addition to this is they are their own customer.

We''ve talked about this.

They''re a AWS scale technology company, but they don''t take outside customers, so they only have to build for their own internal use cases.

Now, this sounds great, but it actually does have these big trade-offs.

You can''t dramatically change what your infrastructure is used for.

It is purpose-built, but it does let you be incredibly efficient and have high performance if you have good communication between the customers, or the app team, or the backend service, and the designers of that data center.

This is completely the opposite of Amazon.

Amazon.

Amazon uses interface so teams don''t have to talk to each other.

At meta, they require incredibly tight communication.

It''s a very different organizational philosophy where they''re like, no, no, not only do we not have external customers, we want this insane-type coupling between our infrastructure and our internal customers.

Anyway, my last one, this is a company that grows intentionally.

It would be easy to look at this company and say, wow, what a viral product.

What a universally applicable product.

That is not the case.

It is unnatural to have connected four billion humans.

This is a freak of nature.

It''s not just something that people adopted.

And so while I think it is totally fair to say, wow, it just like blew up at Harvard, Facebook is the story of 50 different growth tactics in different eras all carefully constructed and iterated upon.

Weightless at colleges, strategically launching at every single college, picking each one for a reason, translation, internationalization, zero rating with carriers to bring new people online, figuring out when they need to do a choir versus build, carefully split testing every change, aligning the whole company on specific networks, on specific metrics, I mean, building relationships with governments in all these different countries and at the very least, complying with local laws on where should we have certain speech laws versus not?

I mean, it is completely unnatural for them to have done what they''ve done.

And it''s all been very, very intentional to connect the world.

Yep.

Okay.

Last playbook theme I''ve got, there''s always another battle for meta.

Yeah.

It''s funny.

I think you could be listening and think like, oh, yes, there''s always another platform battle ahead for a minute.

And that''s probably true.

But I think you actually mean like another societal battle ahead for a minute, right?

Totally.

Yeah.

Now that they''re through the user privacy issues and the many years of the whole 2016 election conversation we talked about and I''m not going to list them all here.

The many, many societal conflicts that they''ve had over and over again.

The current issue for them is around the impact of social media on mental health and in particular teen mental health.

Yep, totally.

And it feels fitting to put this near the conclusion of the episode because while going deep on this wasn''t a part of our understanding of how and why meta as a business works so well, it is a really important topic.

There''s a lot of people making arguments that social media is bad for our brains and the consequences if that ends that being globally true is catastrophic for meta.

Probably a bigger challenge than they''ve ever faced at any other point in history.

So if you''re asking yourself, what are the things to keep an eye on going forward for them?

It is of course all the product innovation and the growth of the existing business and trying to invent the next platform and everything we''ve talked about.

Orion and everything, yep.

Yeah, but it''s also how the mental health issue, understanding all that unfolds and how they handle it.

Yep, totally.

All right, time to land the plane.

Let''s land the plane.

How are you liking this, by the way, this land the plane way of finishing episodes?

Uh, well, I actually have a proposal for you Ben.

Ooh.

I don''t think we have landed unintended on the right nomenclature here or the right, um, construct.

So I actually, we''ve been calling this land the plane, take away the splinter in our minds.

Like, what''s the one thing that''s not going to round for you?

Yeah.

What is the essence of this company?

So I propose that we change the name of this final segment to quintessence.

What is the quintessence?

Yes, this is my inner French literature major coming to bear here unacquired listeners.

What is the essence of this company?

We''ve just spent all this time, all these months studying this company.

What is the very essence of this company that makes it different from any other out there?

All right, I like it.

The quintessence.

Ultimately, my big takeaway is the company moves like water.

It is the company that has connected the world that will always gear up for the next battle and be whatever they need to be in the next era, and whether it''s them defining the next generation of computing or creating all these AI experiences or fending off the next TikTok or the current TikTok, like they just move like water.

Yep.

I totally agree.

I can''t think of a better characterization of this company and how they got to be so darn important in the world, perfect place to end it.

And ultimately, it is still very much a Mark Zuckerberg production.

question.

Yes, that too.

All right, quick carve outs.

Quick carve outs.

My quick carve out is a Google product, actually.

Notebook LM.

This is freaking wild.

Our friend Ben Goin over at the Wall Street Journal who wrote the great piece on acquired a few months back texted us.

What was this?

Two weeks ago, maybe a week ago.

And I was like, have you guys tried this thing?

Notebook LM?

And I think you had me being me.

I hadn''t.

I was like, no, Oh, let me check it out.

I uploaded just the links to the sources that I used for my side of the research for the Microsoft Part One episode, just links.

And when it''s back back out of me, I was like, holy crap.

Yeah, at this point, I think we''re well-passed during test, but it is sort of the most convinced that something is actually a person I''ve ever been.

And if I didn''t upload all the sources and know that it was like unbelievably tailored content to the thing that I just uploaded, I''m not sure I would know that it was AI, it''s pretty amazing.

I have two.

One is a documentary on Netflix called Mr. McMahon.

I was not a pro wrestling person growing up.

I kind of want to go be a pro wrestling person now.

This documentary is incredible.

It is some of the best story telling I''ve ever seen.

And interestingly, it''s a documentary that is told with no narrator.

So there is story arc all throughout the episode exclusively with interview answers.

And you almost don''t notice at some point you finish an episode and you''re like, wait, there was no narration in that.

There was no cheesiness.

It was all first party accounts and then cuts to like old footage of things that aired on TV.

And then the credits come up and of course it''s a ranger production.

and Bill Simmons is the executive producer.

It is remarkable and Mr. McMahon is a singular figure in the world.

Certainly not to be glorified, but one to try and understand.

Oh man, be fun to do a WWE episode someday.

Yes, my second quick one is the Door Cache podcast.

I love the Door Cache podcast.

I also love Door Cache.

And I think that if you like this show, you''ll love listening to the interviews he does.

most recent one, or maybe a couple ago, is with Daniel Jürgen, who is the author of the prize, which is a book, David.

Yeah, yeah.

You and I almost read a whole bunch of it for Standard Oil, and then we realized the Standard Oil sort of over, at least the chapter of Standard Oil that we were covering within like the first two chapters of his book.

And so it''s basically everything from the end of our Standard Oil episode forward on the geopolitics of oil that ended up shaping and informing our world today.

And Dwarkash is just an amazing interviewer and conversationalist.

All right.

Well, with that listeners, a huge thank you to our partners, JP Morgan Payments, Crusoe, Statsig, and Huntress.

You can click the link in the show notes to learn more.

We talk to a ton of people for research on this one.

And while we can''t mention everyone, in part, because the list would just be too long, in other part, with some folks asked not to be think, we do have some specific ones that we want to give a shout out to.

So Alex Schultz, the CMO head of growth analytics, internationalization, great to talk with Baws, Andrew Bawsworth, the CTO, Stephen Levy, who wrote the book Facebook, The Inside Story, was generous with his time Jim Breyer, who led Excel''s Series A investment in Facebook.

Jan LeCoon met his chief AI scientist Alex Heath at the verge for spending his time with me to friend of the show, Arvind Navarathnam from worldly partners who wrote an excellent research report, kind of chronicling everything.

Well, it''s almost like a written version of this podcast.

It''s like a hundred page PDF that was awesome to consume, kind of, to help me remember all the big beats of the story and that his research report is linked in the show notes to Ariel Zuckerberg, Mark''s sister, Cheryl Sandberg, obviously long time COO Mike Shrepfer, the former CTO and now senior fellow to Pete Hunt, early engineer who transferred from Facebook to Instagram post acquisition.

Naomi Glay, who we talked about, founding member of the growth team and the longest employee.

Longest 10-year meta employee at this point besides Mark.

Yep.

To Mike Vernal, former meta VP of Product and Engineering and former Sequoia partner Vijay Raji, former engineer and VP, now of course CEO of Statsig, a partner Romani, a VP in AI data and developer infrastructure at meta, to Owen Van Notta, Facebook''s early COO, and David, I know you have a few as well.

Yeah, a few for me to Adam Dandelo, obviously Facebook''s first CTO, Dan Rose, early partnerships at Facebook, and big, big final thank you that we owe to Chris Cox, Metta''s chief product officer and leader of the entire family of apps over there.

Really this whole past couple of months acquired would not have happened without Chris cold emailing us what about a year ago maybe and saying, hey guys, I love the Nintendo episodes.

And because of that, we met Chris and because of Chris, Mark joined us on stay to Chase Center.

And now here we are doing this episode.

So thank you, Chris, for making it all happen.

Yes.

Essentially, this episode came about because we had done too much research for the Mark interview.

And we were like, we probably should do the actual meta episode to listeners.

A drink I have not been consuming for the last few days because I''m traveling, and it''s the thing that makes me miss home.

I''m in San Francisco, allowing myself to be surrounded and inspired by some incredible software engineering that''s going on here, and putting all the other mess of politics and social bubble stuff aside.

So I''m doing a lot of programming and having a lot of really highly deep technical conversations, but I definitely miss Austin, I miss Texas, I miss Boston walking the halls of MIT, really is the university I intimately know no and there''s something about a university where you can shut off all the mess the outside world and focus on ideas on learning and on discovering plus the fearless energy of undergraduate and graduate students just boldly going forward thinking it can completely revolutionize a field.

That''s really inspiring to be surrounded by.

And in Texas, the thing I love the most is that there''s a simple kindness to the hello, to the nod, to the aimless and wonderful conversation that you might have at a coffee shop when you meet a stranger.

I don''t know.

I really fall in love with Texas.

That''s the other thing about San Francisco that I''m reminded of, that there''s these incredible businesses that are born.

Just a couple of founders and they''re quickly hiring a few folks, especially engineering heavy teams and they''re all dreamers and they''re all pushing forward and they''re all trying to do the craziest shit they can.

Yes, there is a San Francisco bubble.

Yes, there''s a bit of a tunnel vision going on in many ways, but on the pure desire to build something cool Something that has a positive impact on the world.

I don''t know.

That''s a truly inspiring desire But of course sort of from my perspective I Share in that desire There''s a great cost to it as well, and it''s something that is a constant tension in my heart I would like to do more building than talking and I''m reminded of that what I''m here.

Anyway, there is a bit of a mess, a complexity, to the scaling of business, and the running of a business.

What a wonderful human being.

Also Paul Conti.

These are all friends of Andrew Huberman and what just deep and interesting people they are.

I would venture even to say very different, but both just incredible analysts of the human mind.

And what a mystery the mind is.

I''ve been reading a lot of mechanistic interpretability work, which is this whole field of analyzing your own networks and trying to understand what''s going on inside.

And there is just wonderful breakthroughs in that field.

But whenever I''m reading the papers, I can''t help but be caught by the thought that I wish we had this kind of rigor or the possibility of rigor in studying the human mind, sort of neurobiology and neuroscience is too messy, there''s too many variables, there''s too much going on and you can''t do control experiments like you can''t on your own network so anyway the human mind is a beautiful and mysterious thing and if you want to untangle the puzzles going on in there check out betterhelp.com slash Lex and save in your first month that''s betterhelp.com slash Lex.

And I was thinking about that when I was talking to Bernie Sanders and what a genuine human being Bernie is.

First of all, still firing on all cylinders in terms of the sharpness and the depth and the sort of the horse power of his mind.

He''s still there at 83 years old.

Still got it.

And also just has not changed for many, many decades.

I wish there would be more politicians with that kind of integrity, agree or disagree with him.

The man has integrity.

And as we head into this election, I think about the kind of politicians and human beings I would love to see lead our world.

And to me integrity is one of the character traits that is of the highest importance because the pressures when you are at the top leading a nation are immense.

You have written and lectured about serial killers, secret societies, cults and intelligence agency, so we can basically begin at any of these fascinating topics, but let''s begin with intelligence agencies, which has been the most powerful intelligence agency in history.

The most powerful intelligence agency in history.

I mean, it''s an interesting question.

I''d say probably in terms of historical longevity and consistency of performance, that the Russian intelligence services, notice I didn''t say the KGB specifically, but the Russian intelligence services, going back to the Tsarist period, are consistently pretty good, not infallible, none of them are.

Of course, there''s a common Western way of looking at anything Russian.

Very often, I think it''s still the case, Russians are viewed in one or two ways.

either they are bumbling idiots or they are diabolically clever, no sort of middle ground.

And you can find both of those examples in this.

So what I mean by that is that if you''re looking at the modern SVR or FSB which are just two different organizations that used to be part of the one big KGB or the KGB or its predecessors, the Checa, you''re really going back to the late 19th century and the Imperial Russian intelligence security service generally known as the Okrona or Okronka.

It''s really the Department of Police, the Special Corps of Jean-Darms.

Their primary job was protecting the Imperial regime and protecting it against Imperial or other interior enemies.

Revolutionaries for part.

And they got very, very good at that.

By co-opting people within those movements, infiltrating and recruiting informers, agent provocateurs, in fact they excelled at the agent provocateur.

Person you place the site in organization to cause trouble, usually maneuver them into a position of leadership, and they provoke actions that can then allow you to crack down on them.

That is to many sort of lure or bring the target organization into any illegal or open status that it can be more effectively suppressed.

They''re very good at that.

So good that by the early 20th century and the years preceding the Russian Revolution in 1917, they had effectively infiltrated every radical party, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, SRs, great and small, and placed people in positions of influence and leadership.

So the point that arguably, that is, you can debate this, that I think in the whole, they could largely dictate what those parties did.

Nothing was discussed at any central committee meeting of any revolutionary group that the often had people in positions to influence what those decisions were.

Of course, that raises an interesting question, is that if they were that good and they had infiltrated and effectively controlled most of the opposition, then how did the regime get overthrown by revolutionaries?

The answer to that is that it wasn''t overthrown by revolutionaries.

It was overthrown by politicians.

That would then take us into a detour into Russian history.

but I''ll just leave it with this.

If you look at 1917 and you look closely, this is one of the things that I''d always tell my students, is that there are two Russian revolutions in 1917.

There''s the first one in March or February, depending on your calendar, that overthrows Nicholas II.

Revolutionaries are really not involved with that Bolsheviks are nowhere to be seen.

Trotsky and Lenin are nowhere to be seen.

They have nothing to do with that.

The has to do effectively with a a political conspiracy within the Russian parliament, the Duma, to unseat an emperor they thought was, you know, bungling the war and was essentially a loser to begin with.

And it was a coup d''état, a parliamentary coup d''état.

The temporary or provisional government that that revolution put in power was the one overthrown by Lenin eight months later.

And that government was essentially one dominated by moderate socialists.

It was a government that very quickly sort of turned to the left.

You know, the guy we associate with that is Alexander Kerensky.

Alexander Kerensky was a Russian socialist, a politician.

He was the quasi-dictator of that regime.

He''s the person, not the Tsar, who''s overthrown by Lenin.

So the revolutionaries and they did not proved to be the fatal threat to the Tsarist regime.

It was the Tsarist political system itself that did that.

What then transpired was that the Okrona and its method and many of its agents then immediately segwayed over into the new Soviet security surface.

So one of the first things that Lenin did in December of 1917, within a month of seizing power, Or, since the hold on power was tenuous at best, was that, well, you''re going to need some kind of organization to infiltrate and suppress those pesky counter-revolutionaries in foreign imperialists and all of the other enemies that we have.

And so the extraordinary commission to combat counter-revolution and sabotage that Chakka was formed.

You put a veteran Bolshevik Felix Zerszynski at the head of that, someone you could politically rely upon.

But Zerszynski built his organization essentially out of the Okron, I mean, they''re all of these informers sitting around with nothing to do.

And they were employed.

In the early 20s, the kind of rank and file of the Czech might have been 80-90% former imperial officials.

Those were gradually decreased over time.

So why would they do that?

Well, they were professionals.

They also needed to eat, and things were somewhat precarious.

So if your job is to be an agent provocateur or if your job is to infiltrate targeted organizations and lead them astray, you do that for whoever pays you.

That''s part of the professionalism which goes in.

And under But the Soviets, the Soviet intelligence services are also very good at that.

They are very good at infiltrating people into opposing organizations.

And I guess the one example I would give to demonstrate that of the Cambridge 5, the British traders, Soviet standpoint, he rose, who were recruited, known as the most notably Kim Filby, Guy Burgess, Donald McClan, Anthony Blunted.

and there may have been well more than five, but, you know, I wasn''t bad out of just Cambridge.

And then placing those people in high positions, the ultimate goal, of course, is to get your people into positions of leadership and influence in the opposing intelligence service.

And so they did.

Of course, it all fell apart and they ended up in, you know, Phil ended up living the last part of his life in exile in Moscow, but they got their money''s worth out of him.

And you can also find this in KGB Infiltration, the CIA, the FBI, the Aldrich Ames, Hansen cases.

Of course, we were infiltrating by we, I mean the Americas and the West, managed to infiltrate our moles as well.

But if it came down, someone could dispute this, but I think if you were going to come down to a kind of like a who had the most moles superbowl?

Probably the Soviets would come somewhat ahead of that.

So the scale of the infiltration, the number of people, and the scale of it.

Is there a case to be made that the Akrona and the Chakka orchestrated both the components of the Russian Revolution, as you described them.

Well, there''s an interesting question for me, I mean, there are all kinds of questions about this.

I mean, one of the questions is whether or not Lennon was an Okrona agent.

Okay, I''ve just said heresy.

Some people will, I''ll do that quite often because I am a heretic and proud of it.

Great.

Why would you possibly say that Lennon could have been an Okrona agent?

Well, let''s look what he managed to do.

So you had, coming into the 20th century, a single, nominally, a single Marxist movement, the Russian social democratic labor party.

And Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, majority and minority-ites are merely factions of that party and they always agreed that they were all Marxists and we all believe in dialectical materialism and the rise of so we''re all we''re all socialist comrades the difference was the the tactical means by which one would attain this and what Lenin wanted was a militant small-scale vanguard party wanted a revolution I wanted to seize power, seize control of the state, and once you have the state, then you induce socialism from above.

Whereas the majority of the people, the so-called Minishiviks, the minorityites who are oddly enough the vast majority of the party, that''s one of the first things.

How do you lose that argument?

How does the minority get to grab the name majority the ice, but Lenin did that.

So what Len wanted was a conspiratorial party of committed revolutionaries that would plot and scheme and undermine it eventually seized control of the state and induce socialism from above.

There were other Russian Marxists who thought that that sounded vaguely totalitarian and not really democratic and not even terribly socialist.

And they opposed that But ineffectively from the beginning, outmaneuvered every step of the way.

The Mensheviks are a case study in failure of a political organization.

That too will be heresy to some people, but look, they lost.

Now, so what Lenin managed to do, starting around 1903, continuing under this, is he managed to divide, to take what had been a single Marxist party and split it into angry, contending factions.

Because he and his Bolsheviks run one side, advocating a much more militant conspiratorial policy.

The discombobulated men''s shiviks were over in the other, and in between where a lot of people really didn''t know where they stood on this.

I mean, sometimes they kind of agree it seems to making sense today.

No, no, I don''t think he''s making sense in that day.

But he managed to completely disunify this organization.

Now, who could possibly have seen benefit in that?

The Ograna.

Now, whether or not they put him up to it, whether or not in some way they helped move him into a position of leadership or encouraged it or encouraged it through people around him, whether he was a witting or unwitting agent of the Zara''s secret police.

He certainly accomplished exactly what it was that they wanted.

And I find that suspicious.

It''s one of those things that it''s so convenient in a way is that I''m not necessarily sure that was an accident.

There''s also this whole question to me as to what was going on within the Ocronut itself.

Now this is one of these questions when I come to you later about how intelligence agencies interact or serve the governments to which they are theoretically subordinate.

it.

They do tend to acquire a great deal of influence and power.

After all, their main job is to collect information.

And that information could be about all kinds of things, including people within the government structure itself.

And they also know how to leverage that information in a way to get people to do what you want them to do.

So an argument can be made, again, an argument, not a fact merely an opinion, which is mostly what history is made out of, opinions, is that at some point, between about 1919 and 1917, people with the Okrona were playing their own game.

And that game took them in a direction which meant that continued loyalty to the Emperor, specifically to Nicholas II, was no longer part of that.

To me, in a way, it seems almost during the events of 1917 that, one, you had an organization that was very effective when it did this, suddenly it just becomes ineffective.

It doesn''t really disappear.

These things don''t go away because it will reappear, yes, it''s the Ochoca, basically fairly quickly.

But it raises the question to me, is the one degree there were people within the organization who allowed events to take the course they wished.

I always wonder how much deliberate planning there is within an organization like O''Connor, or if there''s kind of a distributed intelligence that happens.

Well, one of the key elements at any kind of intelligence organization or operation is compartmentalization.

Need to know.

So, rarely do you have an occasion where everybody, everybody in an executive position are all brought into a big corporate meeting and we discuss all of the secret operations that are going on.

No, you never do that.

Only a very limited number of people should know about that.

If you have a person who is a case officer who is controlling agents, he''s the only one who should know who those people are.

Possibly his immediate superiors, but no way do you want that to become a knowledge.

So information within the organization itself is compartmentalized.

So you don''t need everybody to be in on it.

You don''t even need necessarily the people who were nominally at the top.

For instance, the Ocrona, the real boss of the Ocrona, was the imperial ministry of the interior.

The minister of the interior, in fact, but the minister of the interior had no real effective control over this at all.

I mean, to the point was that at one point early on, they actually organized the assassination of their own boss.

They have their agents among the revolution, or is killed, the minister of the interior.

Because he''ll disappear, be replaced by another one, he is an imperial bureaucrat.

He''s not really part of their organization.

You know, it''s like a director of an intelligence agency appointed by the president.

Maybe he''s part of the organization.

Maybe he isn''t.

Maybe he is not one of us.

So you''ve got different levels, different compartments within it, and who''s actually running the show, if anyone is, I don''t know.

That''s never supposed to be apparent.

Well, that''s a fascinating question.

I mean, you can see this with NKVD.

It''s obviously an extremely powerful organization that starts to eat itself, where everybody''s pointing fingers internally also, as a way to gain more power.

So the question is, in organizations like that, that are so compartmentalized, where''s the power, where''s the center of power?

Because you would think given that much power, some individual or a group of individuals will start accumulating that power, but it seems like that''s not always a trivial thing.

Because if you get too powerful, the snake eats that person.

Well, we go back into the founder of Soviet secret police, Felix Czezinski.

Czezinski dies in 1926.

Heels over, after giving a heated speech to a party meeting.

Now, the common view, what you usually read, which was key for the time, was that clearly Stalin had him whacked, because anytime someone died, it was almost always it.

And I think a lot of times he did.

but in some cases, Stalin''s probably getting blamed for things that he didn''t actually do.

There''s Jinski wasn''t even opposed to Stalin, so it''s not clear why he would be, but this was that, you know, Stalin died, you know, obviously he was poisoned, something happened, it was an unnatural death, somebody goes in for an operation, you know, it gets a little too much anesthesia, Stalin killed them.

Somebody tips over in a canoe and upstate New York.

Stalin killed them.

There''s actually a case about that.

So that itself can be kind of useful where every time someone dies they think you kill them.

That''s a kind of an interesting method of intimidation in that regard.

But the suspicion he was seemingly firmly in control of the organization.

Of course, maybe he wasn''t.

Maybe he was, my guess would be, is that if Tuzinski''s death was not natural causes, that he was probably eliminated by someone within his own organization.

And then you look at the people who take over.

His immediate success area is, Vyacheslav Menzinski, who''s really not, a really a secret policeman, more kind of intellectual dilatant.

But if you look behind him, Jonas the fellow is Henrik Jagoda.

And Jagoda will really sort of manage things from behind the scenes until Menzinski dies in 1934.

And then Jagoda will hold on till he''s a victim of the purges, I think in 37 or 38.

Yagoda is ambitious, murderous, and if I was going to point the finger to anybody who possibly had Zerszynski whacked, it would be him, and for the purpose is simply of advancement.

That''s the person to look out at any kind of corporate organization is your immediate it, subordinate the person who could move into your job because more than likely that''s exactly what they''re planning to do.

Yeah, just one step away from the very top.

Somebody there will probably accumulate the most power.

You mentioned that the various Russian intelligence agencies were good at creating agent provocateurs infiltrating the halls of power.

What does it take to do that?

Well, there''s an interesting little acronym called MICE, M-I-C-E, and it''s, you know, generally used.

And it''s just the way in which you would acquire, how do you get people to work for you?

Well, M stands for money.

You pay them.

People are greedy.

They want money, you know, if you look at Aldrich Ames, he had a very, very expensive wife with expensive tastes.

So you want him money.

I is for ideology, so during particularly in the 1920s and the 1930s, the Soviets were very effective in exploiting communists, you know, people who wanted to serve the great cause.

Even though that''s initially not really what they wanted to do because the idea was that if you recruit agents from among, let''s say, American communists, you compromise the party because exactly what you''re going to say is that all communists are Soviet spies.

They''re all traders in some way.

So you would really want to keep those two things separate but ideology was just so convenient and those people would just work for you so well.

You could get them to do anything, betray their grandmother.

They would go ahead and do that for the greater good.

So ideology can be a motivation and that can be you know someone who is a who is a devoted Marxist-Leninist.

It can also be someone who''s a disgruntled communist because there''s no anti-communist like an ex-communist.

Those who lose the faith can become very, very useful.

For instance, if you look in the case of American intelligence, the people who essentially temporarily destroyed much of the KGB organization in the U.S. post-World War II, where people like Whitaker Chambers, Lewis Buttens, Elizabeth Bentley, all of those people have been Communist Party members.

They had all been part of the Red Faithful.

They all, for one reason or another, became disillusioned and turned rat, or pig-treat, Whichever case you may want to put in that regard, what is the C in the east hand for?

The C is for coercion.

That''s where you have to persuade someone to work for you.

You have to pressure them.

So usually you blackmail them.

You know, they could be they have a gambling habit, you know, in the old days, it''s very often because they were gay, okay?

Guess them an decision where they can be compromised and you can get them to do your bidding, that those people usually have a certain amount of control.

Here''s an interesting example of how the Ocron attempted to handle this.

I think it''s still largely used.

You''d round up a bunch of revolutionaries on some charge or another distributing revolutionary literature, running any illegal printing press.

You bring a guy into the room and you say, okay, they''re gonna work for us.

Of course, it refused to do so.

And they go, well, if you refuse, we''ll keep the rest of your comrades in jail for a while, you know, maybe beat them with a rubber truncheon or so.

And then we''re just going to let you go.

We''re just going to put you back out on the street.

And if you don''t work for us, we will spread the rumor through our agents already in your organization that you are.

And then what will your comrades do?

How long are you going to live?

So you see you have no choice, your hours, and you''re going to cooperate with us.

And the way that that effectiveness would be insured is that you have multiple agents within the same organization who don''t know who each other are.

That''s very important.

And they''ll all be filing reports.

So let''s say you have three agents inside the central committee of the SR party and there''s a committee meeting and you''re going to look at the reports that well they all better agree with each other, right?

If one person doesn''t report what the other two do then perhaps they''re not entirely doing their job and they can be liquidated at any time.

All you do is drop the dime on them.

and this was done periodically.

In fact, in some cases, you would betray your own agents just to completely discombobulate to the organization.

This happened in one particular case around 1908, the fellow who was the head of the chief revolutionary terrorist organization, which wasn''t Bolshevik, but the so-called socialist revolutionaries.

They''re actually the biggest revolutionary part of the SRs, who are even actually Marxists, more anarchists.

But they went all in for the propaganda of the deed.

They really like blowing people up and carrying out quite a campaign of terrorism.

The fellow who was the head of that terrorist organization, was a fellow of the name of You have no azef, and you have no azef, was guess what?

An Okrona agent.

Everything he did, every assassination that he planned, he did in consultation with his control.

So he''d kind of run out his string, there was increasing suspicion of him.

Me, I was also asking for a lot more money.

So the Okrona itself arranged to have him write it out.

and what did that do?

Well, what do you do in your party when you find out the chief of your terrorist brigade was a secret police agent?

It''s a consternation and mistrust.

Nobody in the party would ever trust in you couldn''t tell who you were sitting around.

I know that a fellow I wrote a biography on Boris Sevinkoff who was a Russian revolutionary and the second in command within the terrorist organization.

By the way, the guy that wanted Ozeth''s job so bad he could taste it.

Well, on the one level, he expressed absolute horror that his boss was a police agent, and will he should, because Seffinkoff was a police agent, too.

See, they already had the number two waiting in the wings to take over.

But he was legitimately shocked.

He didn''t really suspect that.

So it''s a way of manipulating this and then finally become to the E that I think is the most important ego.

Sometimes people spy or betray because of the egotistical satisfaction that they receive.

The sheer kind of Machiavellian joy in deceit.

An example of that would be Kim Filby, one of the Cambridge Five.

Now Filby was a communist, and he would argue that he always saw himself as serving the communist cause.

But he also made this statement, I think it''s in the the preface to his autobiography.

And he This says one never looks twice at the offer of service in elite force.

They saw him by his recruitment by the NKVD in the 1930s, and he was absolutely chuffed by that.

The mere fact that they would want him, what he considered to be a first-rate organization would want him, satisfied his ego.

And if I was to take a gasses to whether it was ideological motivation, whether it was the romance of communism, or there it was the appeal of ego that was the most important in his career or treason, I''d go with ego.

And I think that figures into a lot.

People don''t, someone doesn''t get the promotions that they wanted.

Again, if you look at something like Aldrich Ames career in particular, you''ve got these kind of...

His career in the CIA was hit or miss.

He didn''t get the postings or promotions that he wanted as a value-ish.

You never felt that he got credit for doing that.

And that''s the type of thing that tends to stick in someone''s crawl and can lead for egotistical reasons and adage incentive to betray.

Yeah, that there''s a boost to the ego when you can deceive.

Sort of not played by the rules of the world and just play with powerful people like they''re your pawns.

You''re the only one that knows this.

You''re the only one that knows that the person who is sitting across from you, to which you have sworn your loyalty, you''re simultaneously betraying.

What a rush that must be for some people.

I wonder how many people are susceptible to this.

I would like to believe that people have, a lot of people haven''t the integrity to at least withstand the MI, the money and the ideology, the pull of that, and the ego.

It can also be a combination of the two.

I mean, you can create a recipe of these things, certain amount of money, ego, and the little push of coercion.

But if you don''t, we''ll wrap you up.

You''ll be exposed.

What are some differences to you as we look at the history of the 20th century between the Russian intelligence and the American intelligence in the CIA?

If you look at both the Ochrana and the KGB, one of the things that you find consistent is that they a single organization handled foreign intelligence that is spying upon enemy or hostile governments and also internal security.

So that''s all part of it.

Whereas if you look at the U.S. models that evolve, you eventually have the FBI, who under Hoover, who insists that he''s going to be the counterintelligence force.

Okay, if they''re, you know, if there are commis spies are running around America as the FBI who''s supposed to fair at them out.

The CIA is not supposed to be involved in that.

And the charter, the basic agreement in 1947, did not give the CIA any.

It''s often said they were barred from spying on Americans, which isn''t quite true.

You can always find a way to do that.

What they don''t have is they don''t have any police or judicial powers.

They can''t run around in the country carrying guns to use on people, they can''t arrest you, they can''t interrogate you, they can''t jail you, they have no police or judicial powers.

Now that means they have to get that from someone else, that doesn''t mean that other agencies can''t be brought in or local police officials, corn or whatever you need, you can eventually acquire but they can''t do that directly.

So we''ve got this division between foreign intelligence and domestic counterintelligence, often split between hostile organizations, the relationship between the FBI and the CIA.

I think it''s fair to say it''s not shummy, never has been.

It''s always been a certain amount of rivalry and contention between the two.

And it''s not to say that something like that didn''t exist between the domestic counterintelligence and foreign intelligence components of the KGB, but there would be less of that to a degree because there was a single organization that were all answerable to the same people.

So that gives you a certain greater amount, I think, of leeway and power because you''re controlling both of those ins.

I remember somebody telling me once that and he was a retired KGB officer.

There you go, retired.

One of the things that he found amusing was that in his role, one of the things that he could be is that he could be anywhere at any time in any dress.

Which meant that he could be in or out of uniform and any place at any time.

He was authorized to do that.

So more freedom, more power.

I think one of the things that you would often hit the view is that well, the Russians are simply, you know, naturally meaner.

There''s less respect for human rights.

There''s a greater tendency to abuse power that one might have.

I mean, frankly, they''re all pretty good at that.

They''re probably, it is fair to say that there''s probably some degree of cultural differences that are not necessarily for institutional reasons, but cultural reasons, there could well be things that Americans might bulk it doing more than you would find on the Russian or Soviet side of the equations.

The other aspect of that is that Russian history is long and contentious and bloody.

One of the things that certainly teaches you never trust foreigners.

Every foreign government, anywhere, any country on your border is a real or potential enemy.

They will all, at some point, have given the chance, invade you.

Therefore, they must always be treated with great suspicion.

Oh, it goes back to something, and I think the British observed was that countries don''t have friends, they have interests, and those interests can change over time.

Well, the CIA is probably equally suspicious of all other nations, but you''re supposed to be suspicious.

Your job is not to be trusting.

Yeah, the basic job of an intelligence agency is to safeguard your secrets and steal the other guys and then hide those away.

Are there laws, either intelligence agencies, that they''re not willing to break?

Is it basically lawless operation to where you can break any laws long as it accomplishes the task?

Well, I think John LaCarré gave his pen name.

He was talking about his early recruitment into British intelligence.

And one of the things he remember being told up front, well, If you do this, you have to be willing to lie, and you have to be willing to kill.

Now, those are things that, in ordinary human interactions, are bad things.

Generally, we don''t like it when people lie to us.

We expect that people will act honestly towards us, whether that''s being a business man you''re involved with, your employers.

We''re often disappointed in that because people do lie all the time for a variety of reasons, but honesty is generally considered to be it, but in a realm where deception is a rule, dishonesty is a virtue to be good at that, to be able to lie convincingly is good.

It''s one of things you need to do.

And killing also is generally frowned upon.

You know, put people in prison for that.

There are otherwise executed, but in certain circumstances killing is one of those things that you need to be able to do.

So what he felt he was being told in that case is that, you know, once you enter this realm, the same sort of moral rules that apply in general British society do not apply.

And if you''re squeamish about it, you won''t fit in you have to be able to do those things.

I wonder how often those intelligence agencies in the 20th century and of course the natural question extending it to the 21st century how often they go to the assassination.

How often they go to the kill part of that versus just the espionage.

Let''s take an example from American intelligence, this from the CIA 1950s, 1960s, into the 1970s, M.K. Ultra.

That is a secret program which was involved with what is generally categorized as mind control, which really means messing with people''s heads.

And what was the goal of that?

Well, was, I recently acquired, quite legally, by the way, it''s declassified, but it''s from 1949.

So this is only two years after the CIA came into existence.

And it''s an FBI memo because the FBI, of course, very curious what the CIA is up to.

And the FBI are not part of this meeting, but they have someone in, they''re sort of spying on what''s going going on.

So there was a meeting which was held in a private apartment in New York.

So it''s not held in any kind of, you know, it''s essentially never really happened because it''s in somebody''s house.

But there are a couple of guys there from the CIA.

One of them is Cleve Baxter.

Cleve Baxter is the great godfather of the lie detector.

Pretty much everything that we know or think we know about lie detectors today, you owe to Clee Baxter.

He''s also the same guy that thought that plants could feel, but somehow was a derivative of his work on lie detectors.

So these guys are there and they''re giving a talk to some military and other personnel and there are certain parts of the document which are of course redacted, but you could figure out what it is that they''re talking about and they''re talking about hypnotic suggestion and all the wonderful things that you can potentially do with hypnotic suggestion.

And two of the things they note is that one of the things we could potentially do is erase memories from people''s minds and implant false memories.

That would be really keen to do that, just imagine how that would be done.

So here to me is the interesting point.

They''re talking about this in 1949.

MK Although they''re all sorts of, you know, art and joke, and others, everything is sort of leading up to that.

It''s simply an elaboration of programs that are already there.

I don''t think that it ultimately matters whether you can implant memories or erase memories.

To me, the important part is the thought they could and they were going to try to do it.

And that eventually is what you find out in the efforts made during the 1950s and 60s through MK-Ultra, MK Surge, MK Naomi, and all the others that came out.

That''s one of the things they''re working for, and among the few MK-Ultra era documents that survived, there''s that whole question is that you get someone to put a gun to someone''s head and pull the trigger and then I remember it later, yeah, you could interestingly enough.

So non-direct violence, controlling people''s minds, controlling people''s minds at scale and experimenting with different kinds of ways of doing that.

One person put it that the basic argument there are the basic thing you''re after was to understand the architecture of the human mind, how it worked, how it put together, and then and how you could take those pieces apart and assemble them in different ways.

So this comes, this is where hypnosis comes in, which is a, was then still is, fairly spooky thing.

Nobody''s ever explained to me exactly what it is.

The idea was that could you, you think of the whole possibilities in this case, could you create an alternate personality?

And use that alternate personality in an agent role, but then be able to turn it on and off.

So, subsequently, the person, which that personality inhabited, was captured and interrogated, tortured, you know, and their fingernails torn out, they would have no memory of it.

They couldn''t give any kind of secret away because it was embedded in some part of their brain, where there is a completely different person.

I mean, you can just imagine the possibilities that you can dream up.

And again, it''s not, I think, the question is to whether you, that is possible or whether it was done.

Although I suspect that both of those are true, but that you would try to do it.

Then imagine the mischief that comes out of that.

And one of the big complaints from a legal standpoint about MK Ultra and the rest is that you were having medical experiments, essentially, being carried out on people without their knowledge and against their will, which is, you know, a no-no.

Yeah, the fact that you''re willing to do medical experiments says something about what you''re willing to do.

And I''m sure that same spirit, innovative spirit, persist to this day.

And maybe less so.

I hope less so in the United States, but probably in other intelligence agencies in the world.

Well, one thing that was learned in the reason why most MK Ultra and similar records were destroyed on order in the early 70s, around the time the CIA became under certain amount a scrutiny.

The mid-70s were not a good time for the agency because you had the church committee breathing down their neck.

People were asking lots of questions.

So you need to dump this stuff because you were committing crimes against American citizens.

So let''s eradicate it.

And the important lesson to be learned is that never do this type of thing again, where at least in any way in which the agency''s direct fingerprints are placed on it.

You can pay people, you can subsidize research, you can set up venture capital firms, you got plenty of money, and you can funnel that money into the hands of people who will carry out this research privately, so if something goes wrong, you have perfect deniability.

On the topic of mice, on the topic of money, ideology, coercion, and ego, let me ask you about a conspiracy theory.

So there is a conspiracy theory that the CIA is behind Jeffrey Epstein at a high level if you can just talk about that.

Is that something that''s at all even possible that you have?

Basically, this will be for coercion.

You get a bunch of powerful people to be sexually mischievous and then you collect evidence on them so that you can then have leverage on them.

Well, let''s look at what Epstein was doing.

He was a businessman who then also developed a very lucrative sideline and being a high-level procurer Basically in supplying young girls and He also Filmed much of that activity I Think his partner this Jelaine, and I''m hoping for an out sinker.

I think it''s good lane Gilein?

Well, I''ve heard it both ways.

Gilein or Gilein, whichever it may be.

I think her argument at one point was that, well, we did this to protect ourselves.

But this type of thing has been done before.

There''s nothing new about this.

Getting influential people and compromising situations and filming them.

I could give you another historical example of that in late 19 to an actually The early 1930s, just pre-Nazi Berlin, there was a very prominent sort of would-be psychic and occultist by the name of Eric Jan Hanneson.

He had a private yacht, I think it was called the Seven Sins, and he hosted parties.

He also had a whole club called the Palace of the Occult, which hosted parties where things went on, and there were cameras everywhere.

He filmed, important people.

You know, guys like the brown shirt chief of Berlin in various states of Undress and sexual Congress and he did that for the purposes of blackmail So in Epstein''s case he is a crocure of young girls to wealthy men largely and And many of those events were recorded.

Now, even if it wasn''t his intention to use them for blackmail, think of what someone else could do it because people know about this.

So, you could raise a question, is this not, you know, Epstein is just kind of a greedy pervert.

But through his greedy perversion, he''s now collecting information that could be useful.

Who could that be useful to?

Who would like dirt on Prince Andrew on the clue?

Think of all the people who were there, and there were important people who went to Lolita Island, so if it isn''t Epstein directly, I''m not trying to let him off the hook because to have anything for him.

He was either running his own blackmail business or someone was using him as a front for that.

I mean, I think we''re kidding ourselves.

We''re trying to pretend that''s not what was going on.

So you think you and American intelligence agencies would be willing to swoop in and take advantage of a situation like that?

Well, you know, just in case American politicians could ultimately end up in a position to oversee things like intelligence budgets.

One of them might even become director.

You never know, you can never tell what some crazy president might do.

It could be very, I look, one of the guys who understood the person was, was Jager Hoover.

Jager Hoover spent a long time collecting dossiers and politicians.

How do you think he''d remain director of the FBI as long as he did?

because he systematically collected dirt on people.

So there is a history of this type of thing and again you could argue that''s partly for his protection to keep his job to protect the sanctity and security of the Bureau.

You can find a There is that side to human nature.

Let''s put it that way.

Whether it''s the CIA or a crown, maybe that''s what the president of the United States sees when they show up to office is all the stuff they have on him or her and say that there''s internal mechanism of power that you don''t want to mess with and so you will listen.

Whether that internal mechanism of power is the military industrial complex or whatever, or the bureaucracy of government.

Conducted with the deep state.

The deep state.

Trinch to bureaucratic.

Well, it''s been said, and I think it''s generally true, that bureaucratic creatures, or like any other creatures, it basically exists to perpetuate itself and to grow.

I mean, nobody wants to go out of business.

And of course, you get all of these things like pizegate and accusations of one form or another.

But here''s an interesting thing to consider.

Okay, and I want to argue that I''m not saying that Pizzagate in any way was real or QAnon had to say that, but where do they get these ideas from?

So let''s ask ourselves, do pedophiles exist?

Yeah.

Do organized pedophile organizations exist?

Yeah, they share information, pictures, they''re out there on the dark web.

they cooperate.

So does trial trafficking exist?

Yeah, it does.

So in other words, whether or not specific conspiracy theories about this or that group of organized pedophile cultists is real, all the ingredients for that to be real are there.

Pedophiles exist, organized pedophilia exists, child and human trafficking exists.

At some point, at some time, someone will put all of those together.

In fact, certainly, they already have.

Well, jump around a little bit, but your work is so fascinating.

And it covers so many topics.

So let''s, if we jump into the present with the Bohemian Grove and the Bilderberg, older burgers, so the elites, as I think you''ve referred to them.

So this gathering of the elites, can you, can you just talk about them?

What is, what is this?

Well, first thing I have to point out is that Bohemian Grove is a place not an organization.

It''s where the Bohemian Club meets.

It''s that 2700 acre old growth redwoods, near, you know, north of San Francisco.

The Bohemian Club began the way back to the 1870s.

It''s initial members were mostly journalists.

In fact, supposedly the name itself comes from, it was a term for an itinerary journalist who moved paper to paper was called the Bohemian.

And although I think there may be other reasons why that particular term was chosen as well.

But I think the original five members, there were like three journalists, there was a merchant and there was a ventner guy owned a vineyard''s California house surprising.

None of them terribly wealthy, but they formed an exclusive men''s club, wasn''t still is.

Nothing terribly unusual about that at the time.

But it became fashionable.

And as it became fashionable, more wealthy people wanted to become part of it.

And the thing about getting rich guys to join your club is what rich guys have money.

And of course it''s one of those rich guys that bought Bohemian Grove where now you build your old boy''s summer cab, which is what it is.

They got cabins with goofy names.

They go there.

They perform skits.

They dress up in costumes.

Yeah.

True.

Some of those skits look like pagan human sacrifices, but you know, it''s just a skit.

What''s it really going on there?

So on the one hand, you can argue, look, it''s just, it''s a rich guys club.

They, you know, they like to get out here that the whole motto of the place is weaving spiders come not here.

So when we''re going to talk about business, We just want to get out into the woods, put on some robes, you know, burn a couple of effigies in front of the owl, have a good time, probably get drunk a lot.

What''s with the robes?

Why do they do weird creepy shit?

Why do they put on a mask and the robe and the, and do the plays and the, the owl with the, and the sacrificing, I don''t know, what I, why do you have a giant owl?

I mean, what exactly, why do you do that?

Well, what is that in human nature, because I don''t think rich people are different than not rich people.

What is it about wealth and power that brings that out of people?

Well, part of it is the ritual aspect of it.

And yeah, that clearly is a ritual.

The rituals are pretty simple.

The rituals are just a series of actions performed in a precise sequence to produce an effect.

That describes a lot of things.

It describes plays, symphonies, every movie you''ve ever seen.

A movie is a ritual.

It is a series of actions carried out in a precise sequence to produce an effect, but then it had its soundtrack to cue you to what emotions you''re supposed to be feeling.

It''s a great idea.

So the rich people should just go to a movie or maybe just go to a Taylor Swift concert.

Like, why, why do you have to put it?

Well, why the hell?

Part of it is to create this kind of sense, I suppose, of group solidarity.

You know, you''re, you''re all going to appear and also a way of sort of transcending yourself in a way.

You know, when you put on the robe, it''s like putting on a uniform.

You are in some way a different or more important person.

It''s a ritual.

Okay, the key ritual that became me and Grove is a thing called the cremation of care and cremation.

And that''s what it''s supposed to be.

It''s the, we''re going to put all of our, you know, we''re rich, important people we have to make all of these critical decisions life is so hard.

So we''re going to go out here in the woods, we''re going to kick back, and we''re all going to gather around the lake, and then we''re going to carry, it''s wicker, it''s not a real person.

And how would you know?

And then we''re going to, and this is the cremation of our care, but it''s a ritual which is meant to produce a sense of solidarity and relief among those people who were there.

The question comes down with the rituals is how seriously do you take them?

How important is this to the people who carry them out?

And the interesting answer to that is that for some people, it''s, you know, for some people, it''s just boring.

I mean, there are probably people standing around the owl who think this is ridiculous and can''t wait for it to get over with.

There are the people that are kind of excited about it to get caught up into it.

it, but other people can take it very seriously.

It''s all the matter of the intention that you have about what the ritual means.

And I don''t mean to suggest by that that there''s anything necessarily sinister about what''s going on, but it is clearly a ritual carried out for some kind of group reinforcing purpose.

And you''re absolutely right.

You don''t have to do it that way.

I''ve gone to summer camps and we never carried out mock sacrifices in front of an owl.

We did all those other things.

We didn''t even have any robes either.

So it goes beyond merely a rich guy''s summer camp, although that''s an aspect of it.

But it also I think often obscures that focusing on Bohemian Grove at the getaway of the club ignores that the club is around all the time.

That''s what''s at the center of this.

It is the club and its members.

So despite all the talk about no weaving spiders coming around here, what are the other features of the summer meeting are things called lakeside talks.

And this often people People are invited to go there, and one of the people who was invited, I think around 1968, was Richard Nixon, who was making his political comeback, and he was invited to give a talk, where very important people are listening.

And Nixon, in his memoirs, realized what was going on.

He was being auditioned just whether or not he was going to be right.

He recognized that that was really the beginning of his second presidential campaign.

he was being vetted.

So one of the main theories, call it a conspiracy theory and not about the Bohemian club and the gatherings, is that people of wealth and influence gather together.

And whether or not it''s part of the agenda or not, inevitably you''re going to talk about things of interest.

But to me, the matter of fact that you invite people in, political leaders to give lakeside talks means that there are weaving spiders, which are going on, and it is a perfect private venue to vet people for political office.

I mean, yeah, where else are you going to do it?

If you''re interested in vetting, if you''re interesting and powerful people selecting, well, see, here''s the question, are these guys actually picking who''s going to be president?

Is that the decision which is being made, or they''re just deciding what horses they''re going to back.

I think the latter is the simpler version of it, but it doesn''t mean this the other way around, but these are the kinds of, you know, I mean Nixon was, you know, there was the whole 1960 thing.

So he''s the new Nixon, remember this, and this is where the new Nixon apparently made a good impression on the right people, because he did indeed get the rebel conomination, and he did indeed become president.

Well, there could also be a much more innocent explanation of really, it''s powerful people getting together and having conversations and through that conversation influencing each other''s view of the world and just having a legitimate discussion of policies for policy.

Why wouldn''t they?

I mean, why would you assume that people are not going to do that?

It''s the owl thing with the robes.

Like, why the owl and why are the robes?

Which is why it becomes really compelling when guys like Alex Jones forgive me, but I''ve not watched his documentary.

I probably should at some point about the Bohemian Grove where he claims that there is Satanist, human sacrifice of, I think, children.

And I think that''s quite a popular conspiracy theory.

Or as lost popularity, it kind of like transformed itself into the QAnon set of conspiracy theories.

But I mean, can you speak to that conspiracy?

Let''s put it this way.

The general public rich people are inherently suspicious.

Yeah.

Great.

Let''s put it that way.

First of all, they''ve got all that money and exactly how did one obtain it.

And I do not have necessity adhered to the view that behind ever a great fortune there was a great crime, but there often are ways in which it''s acquired.

But I think it''s one of the things I think they can happen is particularly when people acquire huge amount of money.

And I won''t name any names, but let''s say there are people who perhaps in the tech sphere who, coming from no particular background of wealth, suddenly find themselves with $600 billion.

Well, what?

Well, this is the question you would have to ask yourself, why me?

Because you''re one of the rare, tiny group of human beings will ever have that kind of wealth in your hands.

Even if you are a convinced atheist, I think at some point, you have to begin to suspect that the cosmic muffin, providence, whatever it is, put this money in your hands to do what?

Achieve great thing, just think of all the stuff is.

So you''re going to start a foundation and you''re going to start backing all the things that you like.

This is, yeah, I think there''s an element of ego that comes in with it as well and Again, it may not be so much what the rich person with a huge amount of money at their disposal and a lot of Fuzzy ideas about what to do with it can be influenced by others It''s always that question is to who''s actually manipulating these events?

What''s going on in that regard?

I think in some way they can be a very useful sucker, you know, find somebody with a lot of money and get them to finance the things that you want them to do.

The Bohemian club is, I don''t think any of itself inherently evil or sinister, but it means that there are lots of different people who have different agendas.

It goes back to what I said about how somebody feels about the cremation of care ritual.

This is either just a waste of time, it''s just some sort of silly thing that we''re doing, or it is something of great importance, perhaps even mystical or religious importance, because that''s ostensibly what it''s pretending to be.

So what''s this question?

Is the the play becomes serious.

That tends to happen a lot.

You''ve studied a lot, a lot of cults and occultism.

What do you think is the power of that mystical experience?

Well, what is broadly referred to, well, what''s occultism?

What''s the occult?

The cult is the hidden.

That''s all it really means, specifically hidden from sight.

And the basis of it is the idea that what is hidden?

Well, what is hidden from us is most of the world, most of reality.

So the basic concept within occultism, the basic concept within most religions, which are approved forms of occultism, is that the world, the physical world that we are aware of is only a very small part of a much larger reality.

And that what the methods and practices of occultism, arguably do, is to allow someone to either enter into this larger reality or to access that larger reality for purposes to be exploited here.

The most interesting statement about, and a key element of this becomes the thing called magic.

Now, I don''t know magic, you know, it''s a guy standing on stage performing a trick.

But the interesting thing about a stage magician is that a stage magician is we know when we''re watching this that it''s a trick.

Yet we can''t really figure out if he does it well how that trick is being accomplished because it seems to defy physical laws and that''s what''s fascinating about it.

So even though you know it''s a trick, if you can''t figure it out, it has this kind of power of fascination.

But it''s mimicking something.

Stage magic is mimicking real magic.

So it''s real magic.

Well, let''s go back to Alistair Crowley because, you know, he always has to go.

I knew he was going to come up at some point in this.

really because he always does all roads lead to all roads lead to Alistair Crowley Alistair Crowley and I''ve said this enough so I should be able to get it right but I''m paraphrasing here it goes magic which of course he''s spelled with a K to you know or CK um is the the art and science of causing change to occur in conformity with will So in a way that''s sort of mind over matter, but it''s the idea that one can through will, through intention, bend reality, to make something happen, somebody wants to put it this way, it''s tipping the luck plane, so you know, you got some kind of a level plane, I''m just trying to do it just a little bit so the marble rules rolls over one side or another.

Now that presupposes a lot of things that is there a luck plane?

I don''t know but you know it''s it''s a good sort of idea to have but and here again don''t become overly bothered trying to figure out whether you actually can bend reality.

Become bothered by the fact that there are people who believe that they can and will go to great efforts to do so and will often believe they have succeeded.

So it''s this effort to make things occur in a particular way, maybe just to sort of nudge reality in one little way or another.

And that''s where things like rituals come in.

And rituals are a way of focusing, will and detention.

We''re all there.

We''re all thinking about the same thing.

And you have to imagine just how, you know, the pervasiveness of what could be called that that kind of magical thinking every day, is everywhere.

So let me give you an example.

You ever attended a high school football pep rally?

Think of what''s going on there.

Okay, your team is going to battle the other team.

You''ve now assembled everyone in the gymnasium.

You''ve got people who are dancing around in animal totem costumes.

And what are you chanting?

Everyone is supposed to chant that, you know, that the other team dies, okay, that you will be horribly defeated and that our team will be victorious.

That is a magic ritual.

The idea is, If it comes into this idea, it''s very practically about visualizing things, visualizing, manifesting, I love this term, where you need to manifest your success.

Well, that''s just magic.

That is trying to cause change in conformity with will.

So these things can happen without you being even consciously aware of what''s going on and you don''t need to be, because if you''re all a part of the of the mob, which is there in the gymnasium and you get into this and you get worked up and a cultist would argue what you''re doing is that you''re creating a huge amount of energy.

All these people are putting energy into something and that energy goes somewhere and maybe you can, maybe, just maybe, you actually can slightly increase the chances of your team''s victory.

Of course, your opponents are having their own ritual at the same time, so whoever has the bigger mojo will apparently win on the team.

So that''s a, I would say trivial example of that, but a clear one.

I do believe that there''s incredible power in groups of humans getting together and morphing reality.

I think that''s probably one of the things that made human civilization what it is.

Groups of people be able to believe a thing and bring that belief into reality.

Yes, that''s your exactly right.

Bring to conceive of something and then through intention will to manifest that into this realm.

And of course, that power of the collective mind can be leveraged by charismatic leaders to do all kinds of stuff.

Where you get cults that do horrible things or anything.

There might be a cult that has good things.

It depends.

We don''t call those cults.

Exactly.

Without endorsing this entirely and one of the questions, what''s the difference between a cult and a There''s always someone at the top who knows what''s going on generally who knows it''s a scam In a religion that person is dead.

So see I''ve just managed to insult every single really and and but that''s it It''s an interesting way of thinking about it because I think there is some degree of Accuracy in that statement.

You think actually the interesting psychological question is in in cults, do you think the person at the top always knows that it''s a scam?

Do you think there''s something about the human mind where you gradually begin to believe in you?

Begin to believe your own bullshit.

Yes, that seems to be that again as part of magic I think is believing your own bullshit.

It doesn''t necessarily mean that the head of the cult realized, but there''s someone, maybe the second, you know, always sort of looking in the lieutenant.

Someone probably has an idea about what''s going on.

The other thing it seems to be a kind of dead giveaway for what we call a cult is what''s called excessive reverence for the leader.

People just believe everything these people say.

I give you an example of the first time I ever encountered anything like that.

It was in Santa Barbara, California in the 1970s.

I was going to grad school and there was a particular cult locally.

I think it was Brotherhood of the Sun.

There was a same guy who was among the other things, followers were convinced to hand over all their money and personal belongings to him.

I believe he used part of that money to buy a yacht with.

Anyway, a lot of it went to him.

And then of course, working for free upon different cult-owned business enterprises of which there was several.

And there was a person I knew who became a devoted follower of this.

And it was all I could think of at one point was ask them what What the hell is the matter with you?

I mean, have you lost your mind?

What is it that this person can possibly be providing that you essentially are going to become slave to them, which is what they were doing?

And I actually give that credit in a way of sort of sparking my whole interest in things like secret societies.

And here again, as a disclaimer, I am not now, nor have I ever been the member of any eternal organization, secret society or cult that I know of.

And that''s what interests me about them.

Because I''m just always trying to figure out why people do these things.

See, like I said, why are the robes in the owl?

Why?

Why do you do that?

And it''s trying to figure it out.

I mean, I couldn''t even hack the boy scouts.

Okay, that was too much because to me you join an organization and the first thing it comes along is there''s somebody, there are rules and someone is telling you what to do.

Okay, I don''t like people telling me what to do.

I spent much my life trying to avoid that as much as possible and join a cult, there''s going to be someone telling you what to do.

Join the Bohemian Club and there''s going to be someone telling you what to do.

Obviously, a lot of people really get something out of that.

It becomes in some ways it''s sort of necessary for them to function.

But I do not understand it and my study of it is a personal error to try to understand why people do that.

And there are so many reasons, primary of which I would say is the desire and the human heart to belong.

Yes.

And the dark forms that it takes throughout human history, recent human histories, something I''d love to talk to you a bit about.

If we couldn''t go back to the beginning of the 20th century on the German side, you''ve described how secret societies like the Tule Society lay the foundation for Nazi ideology.

Can you, through that lens, from that perspective describe the rise of the Nazi party.

Well, I guess we could start with what on earth is the Tule Society?

So the Tule Society was a small German occult society.

That is they studied metaphysics, Are they a fancy word for occultism?

That appeared in Munich around 1917, 1918.

The key figure behind it was a German esotericist by the name of Rudolf von Zabotendorf.

Not his real name.

His real name was Adam Rudolf Glower.

He was adopted by a German nobleman, and got the name Phunzebotendorf.

And I like to say that name.

So I had this real thing about vague mysterious characters to show up and do things.

And trying to figure out who these people are.

So we''re working up in the years prior to the First World War.

So the tech editor is probably World War I.

He spends a lot of time in the Ottoman Empire.

Turkey.

It wasn''t on the Ottoman Empire, which was a fairly tumultuous place because in 1908 and 1909 there was a the Young Turk revolution.

You had a military coup which effectively overthrew the Ottoman Sultan and installed a military junta which would go on during the First World War to make its greatest achievement in the Armenian genocide, eventually created a genocidal military regime, which would lead the country into disastrous First World War, which would destroy the Ottoman Empire, out of which modern Turkey emerges, yada yada yada.

And by the way, we should take a tiny tangent here, which is that you refer to the intelligence agencies as being exceptionally successful.

And here in the case of the young Turks being being also very successful or in doing the genocide, meaning they''ve achieved the greatest impact, even though the impact on the scale of good to evil tends towards evil.

It''s one of those things that often comes out of revolutionary situations.

Revolution is always, always seek to make things better, don''t they?

We''re going to take a bad old regime, you know, the the sultan is, you know, and the sultan was bad.

I think it''s fairly sad.

Abdul Hamid II was not a, wasn''t called a red sultan because of his favorite color type, you think.

And the idea is that they were going to improve.

They were now going to, you know, the Ottoman Empire was a multinational empire.

They''re going to try to equalize and bring in the different groups, and none of that happened.

It became worse, okay, in the same way that you could argue that the goal of Russian revolutionaries was to get rid of the bad, old, incompetent Medieval Tsarist regime and to bring in a new, great, shining future, and it became even more authoritarian.

And the crimes of the imperial Russian regime pale the significance of what would follow in the same way that the crimes of Obdolomeid pale to when you get to the young Turks.

But that wasn''t necessarily the intention.

But on the bottom door for the German business man who''s who''s working in this period and at the whole point here is that the Ottoman Empire in this period is is a hotbed of political intrigue.

You know, all kinds of interesting things about it.

The Young Turk Revolution is essentially a military coup, but it is plotted in Masonic lodges.

Okay, I know technically Masonic lodges are never supposed to be involved in politics, but they are, or you know, the large meeting breaks up and then you plot the revolution.

So saying group of people, but it''s not technically the, but yes, and there''s the Macedonia resource a lodge in Tessaloniki was ground zero for plotting this military coup that was supposed to improve the Empire.

Zabotendorf is in one way or another mixed up in all of this, or at least he''s an observer, plus he''s initiated, he''s initiated into the Masonic lodges.

And interestingly enough, the fellow who initiates him into one of these Eastern lodges is a Jewish merchant by the name of Termoody and who''s also a cabalist and in false out so what in the north is very very interested in the occult he''s initiated into Eastern Masonic lodges and appeared when those same lodges are being used as a center for political intrigue.

He also apparently is involved in gun running, which in revolutionary periods is, you know, there''s a lot of money to be made off of that.

So he''s connected to various dark businesses in a tumultuous time with connections to politicized Freemasonry and the occult.

Now, in the course of the First World War, he returns to Germany.

He just shows up.

And it would be my operative suspicion or theory that Zobotendorf was working for someone.

I don''t think he just pops up in Munich on his own accord.

Why does he leave the Ottoman Empire and return to their place?

Who''s behind him?

Well, maybe no one, but maybe someone, because he doesn''t seem to have money at his disposal, and he comes into Munich and he basically takes over this small sort of occult study group.

Now, Now, the interesting thing is that the Tule Society is really just a branch of another existing, what''s called, an aereosophist order, a thing called the German Order or the Germanen Order, which is centered in Berlin.

But for some reason, he doesn''t want his group to be connected by name with the Germanen So, Tuley society, Tuley in this case is a reference to supposedly a mythical, Arctic homeland of the Aryan race.

Apparently, there are all snow people who wander out of the snow at some point.

It''s kind of like a frozen Atlantis.

So, I mentioned these people, the Aureosophists, who, which is, you have to practice saying that.

So, what are they?

Well, they''re a kind of racist, Germanic offshoot of theosophy.

And I know I''m explaining one thing to explain something up, but there''s no other way to do this.

So theosophy was 19th century, very popular and widely modeled, a cult belief that was found by a Russian woman with the name of Helena Blavatsky.

She was a medium psychic, she''s supposed to get channelings from the Ascended Masters.

The basic story there, they''re all of the Ascended Masters, which are mystical beings that may or may not have once been human.

They live inside the Himalayas, or they float among them on a cloud, and they guide the spiritual evolution of humanity.

But Blavansky did was to take Western esotericism and blend it with Hindu and Buddhist esotericism, which became very, very sexy in the West.

Still is.

You know, Buddhism attracts a lot of people because, well, it''s Buddhism.

It''s different, see?

So, you know, the Mahatmas, the Ascended Masters were sent to hear messages.

It''s by the fact that she was later proven pretty much to be a fraud running the letters herself.

Nevertheless, people still went along with this doctrine and it''s been widely modified and copied since then.

So an idea in Theosophyte was that human spiritual evolution was tied to physical evolution.

So in the case of Wolfoski, Lavoski never said that Aryans white people anything out this per superior.

She talked about, you know, the different root races, but it''s just, or a version of it, it''s just total gobbledygoup that seems to include everyone it.

I did defy you to make much sense out of it.

But in the early 20th century, there are different sort of, you know, one of the things that became fashionable, you know, not terribly popular.

These are small movements with the idea idea that, well, Germany is a new upcoming country.

And part of this, I think, was really trying to define who the Germans were because, remember, the German Empire, Germany, as a political state, doesn''t come into existence till 1871.

Prior to that, Germany was a geographic graphic expression, a vague one, which described a large area in central Europe, where a lot of people who wore leather shorts, or something like that, and spoke similar German dialects were nominally Germans, but they might be Prussians or Bavarians, or they came in all sorts of varieties and really so there was no German identity.

something very similar happened in Italy in the same period.

I mean, there were Italians, there were Sardinians, there were Romans, and there were Sicilians, Umbrians, spoke again dialects of a similar language, but it never lived, you know, not since the Roman Empire under a single state and really didn''t think of themselves as the same.

So you have to create this artificial thing.

You all going to be Germans.

Well, exactly what is that?

Much of it is an artificial creation.

You know, you have to decide upon some sort of standard dialect.

Okay, we''ll decide what that is.

You know, often dialect it only a few people actually speak and then they will be drilled into children''s heads through state schooling programs.

So I think this is the kind of milieu that it comes out of.

People who were trying to figure out what on earth Germans actually were and the need for some sort of common identity and you know that leads to everything like Wagnerian opera.

Richard Wagner wanted to create a German mythical music so he went back and stripped mind old German myths and cobbled them together into a lot of people standing on stage singing and that was his purpose.

He was a nationalist.

He was in many ways a kind of racialist nationalist.

This was his idea of trying to create out of bits and pieces of the past a new fangled form of German identity.

On the more mystical end of this, you had the idea that Germany must have been created for some special purpose because the Germans must be very special people.

We must have some particular destiny.

Then out of this, the direction this is heading.

Well, we''re all part of some sort of master race with some sort of ties to some sort of great civilization in the past.

Call it Tully, call it whatever you want to be.

They basically just invent things and try to attach those to the past.

And so Aereosophy was the arianized version of theosophy.

And what this did was to take the idea that That spiritual and physical evolution had led to the most advanced form of human beings, which were the Aryans, and the most advanced group of them were, of course, the Germans.

And this attracted appeal—like, keep in mind, again, this was not a mass movement.

This is very much a fringe movement.

Most people weren''t aware of it and weren''t particularly interested in it, but it had an appeal for those who already had a kind of esoteric bent in some form or another.

And this is where things like the Garman and Orden, the German order and their other groups.

It was only one of many sort of grew out of.

And what it was that the Tule Society as a branch, the Tule Gazelle shaft, was supposed to do was to study this.

It was an esoteric study group.

And so people would get together and they''d talk about things, probably make more stuff up and all sort of work around this idea of German areas is the most advanced type of human beings and all the wonderful things that the future would hold.

And the fact that this was in the midst of a war in which Germany was again fighting, they saw it for its existence, heightened those kinds of tensions as well.

So my suspicion, again, is that Zabotendorf in terms of who was behind him, that he was essentially called back to Germany to work either for the Prussian political police or for some aspect of German intelligence and security to try to mobilize a cultism or esotericism for the war effort.

Again, this is 1918, the war has gone on way too long, but then a few months Germany will collapse and it will collapse simply from the psychological exhaustion of the population.

So, this is almost like to help the war effort with a kind of propaganda, a narrative that can strengthen the will of the German people.

But what''s strengthen the will of some people?

You have to try to appeal to different aspects of this.

But the mystical aspect is one of those things that can be.

You can have a very powerful influence.

And the idea is that if we can come up with some kind of mystical nationalism, maybe that''s one to put it, a kind of mystical nationalism that can be exploited for the workers at this point, you''re kind of grasping at straws.

And this is a whole period when the Germans are marshalling the last of their forces to launch a series of offensives on the western front, the peace offensive, which will initially be successful, but will ultimately fail and lead to a collapse in morale.

But among the leadership of Germany, it was a recognition.

It was that national morale was flagging.

And one of the other things that was kind of raising its head was what had happened nearby a year, well, the Russian Revolution, which had now brought the idea, which brought another solution to all of this.

The idea of revolutionary Marxism.

Here we need to remind ourselves as to where Marxism comes from, not Russia, Germany.

Where was the largest Marxist party in Germany?

And Marx probably expected the revolution to begin in Germany.

Where else?

I mean, the Soviet Union is not very industrialized, Germany is, and so that''s why it would probably Russia at 5% of the population is a industrial workers in Germany.

40% of the population isn''t that.

So if any place was like made for Marxism, it was Germany.

I think that''s why it caught on at East Germany so well because it did kind of come home.

And it was a local belief.

It wasn''t something imparted, imported by the Russians.

It was a German invention.

So, the Tuley Society, one of the things you can see in this is the Tuley Society was particularly involved in sort of anti-Marxist or anti-Bolshevik agitation.

They saw themselves, the Bolton source saw them as this whole mood.

It was a counter to this.

It was a kind of counter-Marxist movement.

Can we sort of try to break that apart in a nuanced way?

So it was a nationalist movement.

The occult was part of the picture.

It occult racial theories.

So there''s a racial component like the Aryan race.

So it''s not just the nation of Germany.

And you take that and contrast it with Marxism.

Do they also formulate that in racial terms?

do they formulate that in national versus global terms like how do they see this Marxism formula is everything by class.

People are categorized by class.

You''re the part of the proletariat or part of the bourgeoisie or just you know you''re the part of the proletariat or just some sort of scum really needs to be swept into the dustbin of history.

Only workers count.

And that was what would take someone who was a nationalist would sort of drive them crazy because their ideas were trying to create a German people.

You know, we''re trying to create a common German identity.

But what the Marxists are doing is they''re providing Germans against each other by class.

German workers hate the German bourgeoisie.

German proletariat is supposed to German capitalists.

We''re all trying to fight this war together.

So that was why Marxism, particularly in the form of Bolsheism, was seen as unpatriotic.

And of course, it was opposed to the war as a whole.

The idea that parody Lenin was that the war was an imperialist war.

And the only thing that was good that was going to come out of it is that the imperialist war through all of the crises it was creating would eventually lead to a class war.

And that would be good because that would reconcile all of these things.

But think of the two very different versions of this, the Bolshevist version, or the Marxist version of Germany, it was going to be a class society in which we''re going to have to have some kind of civil upheaval which will have Germans fighting Germans.

Whereas the kind of mystical nationalism, the almost kind of religious nationalism that Zabotendor from the Tuli society had hitched its wagon to, held that Germans are all part of a single racial family, and that''s what must be the most important thing.

And that these can be different ways of trying to influence people.

It comes down to a matter of political influence.

So in a sense, I think that what Zabotendorff in the Tuley Society was trying to do, at least within Munich, was to use this idea of mystical nationalism as a potential rallying point for some part of the population to oppose these other forces, to keep people fighting.

The war is lost, though, by the, in November, you know, the Kaiser abdicates, and essentially the Socialists do take over in Germany.

That''s, things come very, very close to following the Russian model.

And you even get the Russian version or take on the Bolsheviks, which are the spartisists who try and fail to seize power early on.

But you do essentially end up with the socialist Germany.

And that then leaves, in the aftermath of the war, the Tule Society is sort of the odd man out, although they''re still very closely connected to the army.

Now, here''s one of the things that I find interesting.

When you get into 1919, who is that''s paying the boat and doors the bills, it''s the army.

The one thing the German army is absolutely determined to do is to preserve its social position and power, and they''re perfectly willing to dump the Kaiser to do that.

As sort of this deal, which is made, in November of 1918, Kaiser''s abdication, the proclamation of a German republic, which, you know, you just had this guy declare it.

It wasn''t really planned.

There''s the the Abert Groner Pact.

Groner is the chief of staff, general staff at this point.

Friedrich Abert is the chief socialist politician basically, and they make an agreement.

And the agreement basically is that the army will support Abert''s government if Abert supports the army.

And particularly that means the continuation of the officer corps and the general staff in one form or another.

So a deal is made and that of course is what will eventually help defeat the Spartansist uprising.

Now was the army doing some of the kinds of things that we''ve talked about with the intelligence agencies, this kind of same kind of trying to control the direction of the power.

Well, the German intelligence landscape in the First World War is obscure in many ways.

There are lots of things that are going on.

The German has a military intelligence service called Obtailung or Section 3B.

That''s just plain military intelligence.

You know, they''re constantly trying to collect military information, you know, before the war, about the weaponry and plans of the enemies, and then about what the operational plans were during the war.

It doesn''t really go much beyond that, though.

The German foreign office runs a kind of political intelligence service.

And that''s the one which is much more involved in things like subsidizing subversion in Russia, which is one of the things that the Germans sign on to fairly early.

Little diversion here in 1915, there is a Russian revolutionary who''s lived much of his life in Germany, who goes by the code name of Parvus.

And he essentially comes to the Germans in Constantinople, interesting enough, in Turkey.

He''s hanging around there the same time as the Bolton Dwarf is there, which I find curious.

So Parvus, or Alexander Helpand, to give his actual name, comes in and goes, look, there''s a lot of revolutionaries in Russia and there''s a lot of mistrust with the regime.

We think that the war will increase the contradictions in Russia''s society.

And, if you give me a lot of marks, I can finance this revolutionary activity.

And through subversion, I can take Russia out of the war.

Well, the Germans are facing a two front war.

That sounds great.

We''ll use money in order to, but notice what they''re doing.

The German general staff, a very conservative organization, not a bunch of revolutionaries, are going to finance revolution in an opposing country.

They are going to finance revolutionary subversion to take Russia out of the war, which basically works.

So that gives you another idea as to what the German military is willing to do.

They''re not revolutionaries, but they''ll pay revolutionaries to subvert another regime.

Now you''ve got the problem is that the revolutionary regime that your money helped bring to power is now threatening to extend into your country.

So the whole question for the army and for others in Germany in 1919 is how to keep Germany from going Bolshevik, from an asense being hoist by your own batard.

So the Tuley Society, I don''t think is a huge part of this program, but it is a part of it.

And it''s all an effort to try to keep control.

And that''s why the army is financing them.

That''s even where the army at some point then supplies them with its own propagandists.

So the Tuley Society begins to create under Subbotendor''s leadership what he called the rings of Tully.

And these are satellite organizations that aren''t the society as though, but they''re kind of controlled and inspired by it.

And one of those is the thing called German Workers'' Party.

And the German Workers'' Party again is local, it''s not large, it''s not terribly influential, but what does it aspire to be?

It aspires to be a party that will bring German workers away from the seductive influence of the Bolsheviks and into a more patriotic position, a patriotic.

And the way that I describe this is that it''s not an anti-communist organization.

It''s a counter-communist organization.

So you don''t create something which completely opposes it, you create something which mimics it, which is ultimately what the German Workers'' Party will become, is the National Socialist German Workers'' Party, known as that term, Socialist.

And that is, in my view, what Naziism is from the beginning.

It is a counter-communist movement.

But, and by the way, for people who don''t know, the National Socialist German Workers Party is also known as the Nazi Party.

So how did this evolution happen from those that complicated little interplay?

We should also say that a guy named Adolf Hitler is in the army at this time.

Yes.

Well, he''s going to come into this because remember, the army was going to supply its own propagandists develop the German workers party in the Tully Society do their work and the propagandists they supply them with is a man who the army trains sends to classes to learn the art of public speaking and propaganda and that fellow is corporal Adolf Hitler.

So how does Adolf Hitler connect with the German workers party?

Well, he''d been in the army during the war, the only regular job that he''d ever had.

Kind of liked it.

So, you often get the view that, well, at the end of the war, he joined millions of other German soldiers who didn''t have...

No, no, he stays in the army.

He stays in the army until 1921.

He''s on the army payroll, at the very time in which he is able to help them to set this up.

What appears to have happened is this, Sibotendorf had organized the Tully Society.

that didn''t had, you know, that had had tried to oppose, there''s actually a brief period of time in which the communists actually take over Munich, the Varian Soviet Republic, which doesn''t last very long, and eventually the army and volunteers put this down.

Well, that''s going on, by the way, Hitler is actually setting in the barracks in Munich wearing a red arm band because he is technically part of the soldiers who have got over to the Bavarian Soviet Republic.

He seems to have had flexible interests in this case.

So once order is restored, so to speak, the army comes in and decide that, well, one of the things we need, we need to have people who can lecture soldiers on patriotic topics.

And so there is a particular captain by the name of Karl Meier, who sort of spots Hitler.

He later describes him as like a stray dog looking for a master.

Hitler has a knack for public speaking.

Other soldiers will listen to him.

Yeah, some people can do that.

Some people can''t.

Meier decides that he''s a good candidate for further training.

So yes, they bring him in.

They turn him into a what''s called the Vémon, kind of liaison man.

And he''s an army propagandist.

And then you''ve got this little outfit called the German Workers'' Party.

And essentially what happens is that Hitler is sent in to take over leadership of that, which is what happens.

He shows up.

He attends the meeting.

There are like 50 people there.

By the way, the topic of the first meeting he''s at is how and why capitalism should be abolished, which is not what you might well expect.

And because remember, the German Workers'' Party is trying to cast itself as a counter Bolshevism.

So it''s not saying that capitalism is great, which is important.

Now, capitalism is evil.

We agree upon that.

We just agree it has to be destroyed from a nationalist point of view, as opposed from some sort of strange internationalist point of view.

So Hitler is essentially, as I see it, sent in by the army as their trained man to assume leadership within this small party and to use it for the army''s patriotic propaganda campaign.

And it''s a season doing so, even to the name change, to the national socialist or German workers party.

I mean, really what sounds more red than that?

So the interesting thing here is, from where did anti-Semitism seep into this whole thing?

It seems like the way they tried to formulate counter-Marxism is by saying the problem with capitalism and the problem with Marxism is that it''s really Judeo-capitalism and, quote, Judeo-Bolshevism.

From where did that ideology see been?

Well, that''s a huge topic.

Where does anti-Semitism come from?

Well, let''s start with that term itself, a term which I really grew increasingly to dislike, because it doesn''t actually say what it means.

means.

Anti-Semitism is anti-Jewism.

That''s all it is.

I''m not sure whether there is ever existed a person who hated Jews, Arabs, and Maltese equally.

That''s kind of hard to imagine.

I don''t know, but that''s technically what that would mean, because let''s face it, most semites are Arabs.

So if you''re an anti-Semite, then you don''t seem to distinguish choose from Arabs.

It makes no sense.

The origin of the term is invented by guess what?

An anti-Semite.

A guy in the 1870s, a German journalist by the name of Wilhelm Mar, who is, wouldn''t you know it, part Jewish himself, and who decides that you really need a better term than Uden Haas, Jew hate, which was the term because that just sounds so, you know, in elegant, doesn''t it?

Okay.

What do you want to call yourself a Jew-hater or an anti-Semite?

See, anti-Semitism, it''s got that ism part of the end of it, which means it''s a system of belief.

Anything that has an ism must somehow be scientific and important.

So, a part of the 19th century obsession with bringing, trying to bring science into something on one of the others.

So we''re going to get rid of Jew hate and we''re going to turn it into anti-Semitism.

And we''re only going to be talking about Jews, but we''ll never actually say that.

And somehow the invention of a Jew-hater to disguise the fact that he''s a Jew-hater, even though he''s partly Jewish, by inventing the term anti-Semitism, worked because everybody has bought it repeated did it ever since.

So, you know, I don''t know.

Maybe just because anti-Jewism would just be, is it too direct in some way?

Is it what we have difficulty confronting actually what is we''re talking about?

I do wish terms were a little bit more direct and self-explanatory, yeah.

Jew hate is a better term.

Well, the question thing comes, what exactly do you hate about Jews?

and a lot of this has to do with.

If you go back part of the 19th century, if Jews were hated, they were hated for religious reasons.

In Christian Europe, they''re hated because they weren''t Christians.

And they existed as the only kind of significant religious minority, but other than that, they tended to live separately.

They had little economic influence.

But Jews tend to live in stettles in the east, ghettos, elsewhere, and some were involved in banking and business, but they sort of remained segregated from much of society.

That changes when you get to the 19th century, and with what''s called Jewish emancipation.

And that means that between about 1,850 most European countries drop the various legal or social restrictions against Jews.

They are assimilated into the general society.

So ideally you stop being a German Jew and you become a Jewish German.

Those are two very different important concepts.

And what that does of course is that it opens up the professions, business world elsewhere.

were.

So Jews move who had been largely within those realms to begin with, they already had a good deal of experiencing and experiencing in banking business.

And they move into those areas and professions and become quite visible.

And that''s what then creates anti-Semitism.

Because in some way that is seen as part of the changes that have taken place, and there are a lot of things going on here, part of it has to do with the kind of wrenching social and economic changes that took place with industrialization.

So one of the things to keep in mind is that in the process of industrialization, just like today, whole classes of people were made extinct economically, craftsmen, for instance.

So, when factories came along and began to produce things with machines, all the crafts people who had made those things previously are now unemployed or go to work as wage labor in factories.

centuries.

So there are winners and losers in industrialization.

And what people saw in Germany and elsewhere is that among this new sort of rising capitalist elite, among these new professions, among the bureaucrats that are coming out of these burgeoning states, they were visibly a fair number of Jews.

So in some way, the rise of Jews in the minds of many people were connected to all of the other bad things that were going on.

Now the world was changing in a way we don''t like.

And seemingly the Jews are prospering while I am not.

And that was during Germany and elsewhere Jews became highly visible in the professions.

They became very visible in banking, they became visible in legal profession, they became visible in the medical profession.

And those are people that a lot of people would come in contact with, bankers, lawyers, and doctors.

They were not the majority of there, but vastly over-represented in terms of the general population, and especially within the cities.

So in that sense, the roots of anti-Semitism is that Jews in Germany and elsewhere, and not just in Germany by enemies, France, Britain, everywhere else, became identified with the bad changes that were that were taking place.

And but you also found that Jews were not only prominent among capitalists, they were also prominent among in the socialist movement as well.

So one of the things you could look around, we returned to Germany in 1919 in the aftermath of World War I, and you look around in Bavaria or elsewhere, you tend to find that there are a lot of Jews in visible positions on the German left.

Rose Luxembourg is but one example of that.

You know, Oigen Levine, some of them came in from Russia.

You know, when the Soviets send a representative to Germany in this period, it''s Karl Radek, a Jew.

so it wasn''t difficult to exploit that to argue that just as the ranks of capitalism was full of Jews, the ranks of Bolshevism or of the revolutionary left were full of Jews because you could easily go around and distinguish a great many of them.

They don''t have to be the majority, they just have to be numerous prominent invisible, which they were.

So this provided you a, in case of the propaganda of the German army, the type of stuff that Hitler was spewed out, they could put all the anti-capitalist rhetoric in there wanted to.

The army was never going to overthrow capitalism, and the capitalists knew they weren''t going to do it.

So go ahead.

Talk shit about us.

We don''t really care.

That''s not going to, because we know that the army would prevent that from happening.

The way to then undermine the real enemy, it was a scene, the the revolutionary left was to point out the the Jewish influence there.

I mean, look at Russia.

Well, Lenin is up at Trotsky.

There he is.

Look, there''s a Jew.

There''s one.

Rodik is a Jew.

It wasn''t hard to find him in that regard.

You gave a lecture on the protocols of the Elders of Zion.

It''s why they consider to be the most influential work of anti-Semitism ever, perhaps.

Can you describe this text?

Well, the protocols of the learned elders of Zion is probably one of the most troublesome and destructive works of literature that has ever emerged.

And yet its origins remain obscure, so you get a whole variety of stories about where it came from.

So the one story that is often used that it was the work of the Okrona, the Russian secret police, and in particular, it was all crafted in 1904 and 1905 in Paris.

There''s a whole description of Piotr Rajkovsky, who was the, supposed to be the chief of the Okron at the time, was the man behind it, and other fellow by the name of Matveg Olavinsky was the drafter of it, And that they had this document written by a French political writer from some decades back called Dialog and Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, which they were then adapting, usually it''s argued that they plagiarized it into the protocols.

And none of that is really true.

I mean the first part about it is that at the time this supposedly took place Raj Kufsi wasn''t working for the Okrona.

He''d been fired and he wasn''t in Paris and the whole situation which is described couldn''t have taken place because the people who did it weren''t there.

It''s a story.

But it provides a kind of explanation for it.

So the protocols emerge.

So they always have to go back.

This is one of the things that I have found always useful in research is go back to the beginning.

Find the first place this is mentioned or the first version or the first iteration.

Where does it start?

So you go back to St. Petersburg, Russia, run 1903.

There is a small, right-wing anti-Semitic newspaper, published there called Znamya, banner.

And it publishes in a kind of serial form a work that doesn''t credit with any original author.

And this is the first version of the protocols of the learned elders of Zion.

But what it''s actually describing is a Judeo-Musonic plot to rule the world.

Those two terms are always combined together.

And I think in the earlier version, there''s far more mentions of Freemasons than there are Jews.

views.

And it''s, you know, the publisher of Namya, it''s closely connected to a thing called the Union of Russian people, the Union of Russian men, which was ostensibly existed to defend the empire against subversion, particularly against what it thought was Jewish subversion, when they also argued that the prominence of Jews in revolutionary movements but somehow proved that this was in some way a Jewish revolution.

But again, this is not a mainstream newspaper, it''s not appealing to a mainstream population very people saw it, but this is where it appears.

Now, keep in mind, that''s two or three years before it''s usually said to have been written, or the other version is that there''s this crazy priest by the name of Sergei Nielis and he wrote it, or he had actually handed it as an appendix to his work.

in 1905.

Now it was it was around before that.

So Nielis didn''t create it.

It wasn''t drafted in Paris in 1904 or 1905.

It was serialized in an obscure right wing Russian newspaper 1903.

And by the way we should say that these are 24 protocols.

Well it varies.

It varies.

that are, I guess, supposed to be like meeting notes about the supposed cabal where the Jews and Freemasons are planning together a world domination, but it''s like meeting notes, right?

Protocol or what''s your Russian term basically for notes of a meeting?

Yeah.

Well, it''s notes of a meeting is the goofiest things I''ve ever seen because what you''ve gone here, it''s not notes.

No one takes notes from a meeting that way.

What you''ve got is like the exposition of a bond villain.

Right.

Yes, all of this, all of them are going to do this.

And then the last thing you want to do is lay out your, if you get a plan for world domination, my suggestion would be don''t write it down.

So it''s not notes of a meeting.

It''s again, it''s another sort of narrative or story that''s being told.

It bears no resemblance to the dialogue and hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu.

But what it is, the best thing, it''s not particularly readable in some ways.

There was an Italian writer and then Chaserai Mikkailas, who wrote a book, translated in English called the non-existent manuscript.

And what it is is that he takes the different versions, starting with the 1902, 1903 versions, and looks through the other ones, and he tries to process to reconstruct what he thinks the original might have been.

But the other thing he does, which was fascinating to me, is that he takes This whole sort of initial text and in bold type, he indicates the paragraphs, but more often sentences or phrases that appear to be identical from the Joli work.

And they''re just scattered throughout it.

There''s no particular rhyme or reason to it.

You don''t plagiarize that way.

I mean, who does that?

It''s sentence here, sentence there, which is led to a peculiar theory of mine, which of course I will have to expound upon, which is that I think that the original author of the protocols was the same Maurice Jolie.

I think what someone stumbled across was a work which he wrote and never published, and which he just drew.

It''s exactly what someone would do, working from your own kind of material.

Because I''ve written things and then taken what I''ve written and then repackaged that into something else.

And the same sort of thing comes out, only bits and pieces of it remain.

So, why would Joli have done that?

Joli was, or talking about a man whose career basically expand the 1850s to 1870s.

He''s an obscure figure.

I''m not even totally sure he existed.

I mean, but it''s one of those things you go looking for him.

I love that you''re a scholar of people that just kind of emerged out of like the darkness.

They just they just come from nowhere.

And there''s the crown of there also.

And we should also say this was I guess the original would I mean, what''s the language of the original?

Russian?

Russian.

But my hunch is that that''s adopted from a French version.

First of all, they''re constantly harping on free maces, which isn''t nearly as big an idea as they''re there.

If you go back to France in the 1890s, there''s some big scandals.

Well, there''s the Drifus scandal that we got that.

All right, well, you''ve got a Jewish officer on trial for being a traitor, all right?

So that was pro.

So you bring in the whole Jewish element, juice is disloyal, Drifus case 1894.

Earlier you had the Panama scandal, which was this huge investment scandal when the Panama Canal Company in Paris collapsed and again many of the major players in that work Jewish financiers.

And then you''ve got the taxal hoax.

So the taxal hoax was the work of this guy, his real name was, I think, Joghan Paje.

He was kind of a French journalist.

He started out writing porn.

So when he wrote things like sex lives of the popes and, you know, the erotic bible and various things of that kind, he was a Catholic, broke with the Catholic church, wrote bad stuff about the popes, and apparently became a Freemason for a while, and then supposedly recanted his evil ways, went back to the church, and then under the name Leo Taxil began writing these whole series of articles, basically arguing that there was a Masonic satanic conspiracy, run by the way by an American, Albert Pike.

And this also included child sacrifice.

It''s got pizzeria, and it is wealth by a high priestess, Diana von.

And so there''s like child sacrifice, you know, weird roby bohemian grove stuff.

And the Freemasons are devil worshippers going back to the night''s Templars.

And so there''s a thing called the devil in the 19th century in the secrets of Freemasonry.

And this became a bestseller in France.

So France is just obsessed with all these all these kinds of conspiracy.

So evil Satanic Freemasons, evil Jewish financiers, Drifus.

Yes, this is the brew where all of this comes out.

I want to figure out how Freemasons and Jews get connected together.

France is the place where this happens.

Now, taxil, or Jogampage, eventually pulls another interesting thing in this.

Around 1897, critics argue that he''s making this stuff up and demand that he present Diana Vaughn, supposed satanic, high priestess, toddler killer.

And he says, oh, we''re gonna have a press conference.

She''ll appear and say all of this stuff as she returns to the church and, you know, possibly becomes a nun.

And so people show up, you know, I''ve figured some of the Catholic church shows up and he does no Diana Vaughn and Dogan Pestay goes, it''s all a hoax, I made it up.

You''re all a bunch of idiots for believing it.

Okay, you, you members of the church, especially, just a little bit gullible, you know, morons you are.

And that''s it.

He confesses it to this day, however, you will find people who will insist that it''s actually true because they desperately want it to be true.

But this is, I think, the milieu that, I like that word, apparently, that this comes out of, and this is this is this whole kind of unhealthy mix.

So, France, to me, is the only place then in the decade preceding it that something like this would be concocted.

So it was either created by some sort of unknown person there, but I still think that even though he dies in like 1879, that in Maurice Jolie''s troubled career, he went from being an opponent of French emperor Napoleon III, which is what the whole dialogues was written against.

And then he was, for a time, a close political ally of a French politician by the name of Adolf Cremieux.

So Adolf Cremieux, well, what''s he got going for?

And while he was kind of a radical politician, he was an opponent of Napoleon III.

He was a free Mason.

Oh, and he was Jewish.

In fact, at I think he was actually the head both of the Scottish right in France, and I have been an important figure in the Alliance, Israeli, the Jewish organization in France.

So he was publicly, very prominently Jewish and Masonic.

So someone else who would have linked them to get, Joli, as he did with virtually everyone, This is a guy whose life largely consisted of dual threats and fist fights.

So he gets angry at Cormue.

And it''s exactly the type of thing that he might write to vent his spleen about it.

But he died.

Probably a suicide.

That''s kind of difficult to tell.

In obscurity, his son seems to have inherited most of his literary works.

And his son then worked for New became a journalist to work for newspapers in France in the 1890s, but was also associated with some people on the fringes of the Okrona or the Russian press in France.

So one of the little things that had happened by this time is that France and Russia had become allies, even though their political systems were completely incompatible.

And so the Russians were using money to subsidize French newspapers that were championing the alliance between the two, Russian meddling, okay.

Now, they''re just paying to have the right kind of newspapers come out.

So there''s this whole connection between the kind of Russian journalistic world and the French journalistic world and all of these scandals which are going on and jolly sun and then, you know, 10 years down the road, this thing pops up in a newspaper and St. Peter''s bird.

That''s where I think the origins lay.

Why do you think it took off?

Why do you think it grabbed a large number of people''s imaginations?

And even after it was shown to be not actually what it''s supposed to be, people still believe it''s real.

Well, it doesn''t take off immediately.

Okay, it never receives any kind of wide.

I mean, nobody much reads the first edition of it.

When it''s re-edited, it keeps getting, there is something like 18 or 19 different versions as it goes through.

I mean, it gets, you know, people leave this protocol out or leave another one.

As time goes on, there''s more and more emphasis on Jews and less and less on Freemasons.

So it''s sort of, and the whole thing could have begun as an anti-masonic tract.

You could leave Jews out of it entirely and just turn it into a Masonic plot to rule the world.

But let''s just throw them in, as well, since the two things are already being combined elsewhere.

It doesn''t become a big deal until really after the first World War, because the initial versions of it are all in Russian, and let''s face it, well, that''s widely read in Russia.

It''s not much read anywhere else.

It''s a different alphabet.

Nobody can even see what it means.

So it has no particular influence outside of Russia, but then you get to 1919 and you get all these different versions of it.

So suddenly you get two English versions in the US, another English version in Britain, a German edition, a French edition, a Dutch edition.

everybody is coming up with these things.

So it''s not until I mean the immediate aftermath of the First World War that this metastasizes and it begins to show up in all of these different foreign editions.

And I think that it just has to do with the changes that have taken place during the war.

One of the things that people began looking for was that why was there a war?

And we just had this This whole disastrous war in the world has been turned upside down.

So there has to be some kind of explanation for that.

I don''t know.

And one of the things this offer to see, there''s this evil plan.

There''s this evil plan that has been put into motion.

And this could possibly explain what''s taking place.

The reason with the protocols were, I think, widely bought then and where they still are many ways is the same reason that the taxhole hoax I was talking about was because it told a story that people wanted to believe.

So in France in the 1890s, there was widespread suspicion of Freemasons.

It was seen as a somewhat sinister secretive organization, certainly secretive.

And there was also the same sort of generalized prejudices about Jews, clannish, distinct, too much influence, all of the things that went on.

So it was sort of easy to combine those two things together.

And even though taxal admits it was a hoax, There were those who argued that this is just too, it''s too accurate.

It describes things too completely to be a hoax.

And then you get the same arguments.

In fact, I''ve heard the same arguments with a protocol.

I don''t even buy this as an example of plagiarism because you can''t actually prove what''s being plagiarized in any sense.

To me, the protocols are a prime example of what I call a turd on a plate.

These things crop up.

I have to explain that now, but I have to wait.

What has it turned on a plate?

Well, it turned on a plate is a turd on a plate.

Suppose you come in and there''s a plate sitting on the table and there''s a turd on it.

Now the first thing you''re going to want is, is that a turd?

Is it a human turd?

Where did it come from?

Who is, why would someone poop on a plate?

There are all these questions that come demand.

It makes no sense.

But that''s what you come, it''s just there.

Right?

I don''t know where it came from.

I don''t know why, but there''s a turd on a plate.

And that''s what the protocols are.

They''re just there.

But the reality is just like with a turd on a plate, you take a picture of that in modern day and it becomes a meme, becomes viral and becomes a joke on all social media.

And now it''s viewed by tens of millions of people or whatever, it becomes popular.

So wherever the theory came from, it did captivate the imagination.

Yeah.

It did speak to something.

Was it seemed to provide an explanation?

Can you just speak to Jew hatred?

Is it just an accident of history?

Why was it the Jews versus the Freemasons?

Is it the collective mind searching for a small group to blame for the pains of civilization?

And then Jews just happened to be the thing that was selected at that moment in history?

It goes all the way back to the Greeks.

Let''s blame them.

So one of the first Just occasions you find the idea that Jews are a distinct, mean-spirited, nasty people.

Goes back to and a Greco-Egyptian historian named Manito.

This is around, I think, 300 BC.

early, can''t even rope the Romans into this one.

Some Anitho is trying to write a history of the dynasties of Egypt.

I think his history of dynasties of Egypt still was one of the basic works in this, but he tells this whole story which essentially describes the kind of first blood libels that the Jews to celebrate their various religious holidays would capture Greeks and fatten them up in the basement and then slaughter them and eat them or drain their blood or do something.

Yeah, it''s just the sort of really your version of that time.

Also, I think it repeats the sort of Egyptian version of the Exodus out of Egypt, which is quite different than the biblical version.

In this case, the Egyptian, they worked as they stole all the stuff out of the Egyptian''s houses and ran off into the desert.

The Jews stole all the stuff and ran off.

Yeah, Hebrews.

Hebrews robbed the Egyptians, they were taken in, you know, we took them in and sheltered them, gave them jobs, and then they like stole all the jewelry and ran away.

We didn''t even chase them.

We were glad to see them gone.

So it''s a different narrative on that story.

But it essentially portrays the Jews as being hostile, you know, that they don''t like other people.

They''re contemptuous of other people''s religions, the rest of it.

And see, the Greeks tended to think of themselves as being extremely cosmopolitan.

Now, the Greeks run across people worshipping other gods.

They go, oh, this is just our gods and her different names.

Okay, everything was sort of adjusted into their landscape.

So you ended with that kind of hostility, which was there at the time, and that was probably influenced also by some of these earlier rebellions that had taken place in Egypt.

During the Roman period, you not only have the Judean rebellion in 70 AD, but you have a couple of other uprisings in North Africa and very bloody affairs, and in some cases Jews begin massacering other people around them.

They start killing the Greeks, the Greeks start killing them.

So there was a fair amount of, from that period on, a certain amount of bad blood of mutual contempt between Greeks or between hellings, between the people who became Hellenized as the Romans would be, and the Jews.

And the Romans also seemed to develop much of that idea.

They considered Judea as being a horrible place to have to govern, inhabited by a stubborn, obnoxious people.

Not well liked.

So that''s really where you see the earliest version of that.

And the reasons for it would be complicate.

What you could say is that going back to Manito and to the Roman period, Jews, Judeans frequently experienced difficulties, conflicts with other people living around them.

And part of that probably had to do with the diaspora, which was the movement.

Well, you know, you get the idea that the Romans came and he kicked everybody out, which they didn''t.

Jews had been leaving Judea since it was a poor limited area and moving into areas like North Africa, Egypt, or an acre all the way into southern France.

They moved widely around the Roman Empire.

So that sense of both distinctness and hostility existed since ancient times.

So it wasn''t just the attitude of the church towards Jews was mixed by, well, one of the ideas, of course, is that at the end of time, you know, just before the second coming, One of the signs, how are we going to know that Jesus is going to return and the world is going to end?

Well, the Jews will all convert.

There will be a mass conversion, they''ll sort of see the light.

Now, so there have to be Jews around to do that, or we won''t, you know, it''s like a canary in a coal mine.

You have to have them there to tip it off.

So that was one of the arguments as to why within the church, as to why Jews would not be forcibly converted.

beyond the fact that it''s just kind of bad policy to forcibly convert people because you don''t know whether it''s sincere, but they need to be preserved as a kind of artifact which will then redeem itself at the end of time.

It''s not something which is encouraged, it predates Christianity.

And then Christianity, of course, in its own way, just sort of plagiarizes the whole Jewish thing, doesn''t it?

I mean, I hesitate to use that term, but that''s what you do.

It''s just like, well, we''re the Jews now.

Okay, you used to have a unique relationship with God, but now it''s been passed over to us.

And so, you know, thanks for the Bible.

You know, I can remember that.

And my mom''s side, I was periodically exposed to Sunday school.

And pretty much the Old Testament was always presented as if somehow it was the, you know, the history of like, with lack of better term, you know, Europeans in some way.

It was sort of a Christian history.

It was all the prequel to that.

And there''d be some sort of, first the term Hebrew was always used, never Jews.

So the ancient Hebrews, and somehow the Hebrews just sort of became the Christians.

And I don''t know, the Jews just got, they didn''t get a memo or something.

So it''s basically like Christianity, the prequel, is the Old Testament.

But they just sort of take over.

Okay, we have the special dispensation now.

Thank you very much.

You''re an artifact.

So it''s interesting.

So this whole narrative that I would say is that was kind of like a viral meme started as you described in 300 BC and just carried on various forms and morphed itself and arrived after the Industrial Revolution into it in a new form to the 19th and 20th century.

And then somehow captivated everybody''s imagination.

I think that modern anti-Semitism is very much a creation of the modern world and the industrial revolution.

It''s largely a creation of Jewish emancipation.

It''s the nasty flip side of that.

All of the restrictions that are thrown off, but now also you become the focus of much more attention that what you had before.

Prior to that, you had the kind of ghettoization, which worked both ways.

Rabbis who praised the ghetto is a protection of Jews against the outside world, because inside we can live our life as we wish and we''re unmolested.

Whereas if we were the great fears that if we were sort of absorbed into this larger world, we''ll lose our identity.

That sort of question comes up in the 18th century and things like the Haskell movement in Germany, because the German Jews were always at the sort of cutting edge of assimilation and mordernity and Moses Mendelssohn was an example of that.

You are arguing that you know, we just need to become Germans.

So, you know, as much as possible synagogue should we look like Lutheran churches, everything you think should be given in good German, and that''s the way we need to become Jewish Germans.

We don''t we don''t want to become a kind of group of people who are who are a part in that way and that It''s created great tensions Ever since you know one of the essential points.

It seems to me in anti-Semitism Anti-Jewism is that all the Jews are in us together.

Isn''t that one of the things?

Okay, they''re always talking about as if they''re collective Jews this Jews that as if it''s it''s a single undifferentiated mass of people who all move and speak in the same way.

From my personal experience, not being Jewish, I''ve incredibly diverse.

In many ways really, one of the things that anti-Semitism proposes is a continuity or singularity of Jewish identity that never existed.

Just like you said, in one hand, there''s a good story, in the other hand, it''s the truth, and oftentimes, the good story wins out, and there''s something about the idea that there''s a cabal of people, whatever they are, in this case, our discussion is Jews seeking world domination, controlling everybody, is somehow a compelling story.

It gives us a direction of a people''s, to fight, of people''s to hate, on which we project our pain because life is difficult, life for many, for most is full of suffering.

And so we channel that suffering into hatred towards the other.

Maybe if you can just zoom out, what do you from this particular discussion learn about human nature that we pick the other in this kind of way?

and we divide each other up in groups and then construct stories and like constructing those stories and they become really viral and sexy to us and then we channel the hatred.

We use those stories to channel hatred towards the other.

Well you know Jews don''t think only a recipient of that I mean any any time you hear people talking about Jews disser that white people disser that black people this or that, Asians this or that, were it they''re an undifferentiated mass, who apparently all share something in common.

Well, then nobody''s really thinking.

The other thing you''ll find is that people who will express those views when press will argue that, oh, well, this, you know, if they actually know anybody from those groups, those are okay.

It''s like Nazis.

Oh, they go, this isn''t okay, They were always being constantly making exceptions and one for what they actually met an actual human being, and they seemed to be fairly normal while they were okay.

So what it was that they hated weren''t actual people for the most part, it was just this kind of golly-wag vision that they had of them, you''re not even talking about real people.

I don''t know.

What does that tell you about human nature?

Well, okay.

In 70 odd years, what have I learned about my fellow creatures?

One, I don''t actually understand them any better than I ever did.

In fact, less so.

Okay.

I would say this.

When I was 17, I thought I had the world much more figured out than I do now.

Completely deleted.

But you know, It seemed to make much more sense, and I could categorize things.

Basic take upon human beings, most people, most of the time, are polite, cooperative, and kind until they''re not.

And the exact tipping point and moment in which they go from one to the other is unpredictable.

God that''s brilliantly put.

Speaking of the tipping point, you gave a series of lectures on murderers, crimes in the 20th century.

One of the crimes that you described is the Manson family murders.

And that combines a lot of the elements of what we''ve been talking about and a lot of the elements of the human nature that you just described.

So can you just tell the story at a high level as you understand it?

The Manson Philly.

What do you begin with Charles Manson?

Who''s the key element in this?

And Charles Manson, for most of his life, up until the time, that he''s around 33, is an unexceptional petty criminal.

In and out of prison, reform school from an early age, not really associated with violent crimes, he did stuff like steel cars, right bad checks, became an unsuccessful Pimp and Drug Dealer.

So around 1967 he gets out of his latest stint in federal walk-up and terminal island during Los Angeles, California.

By that time he''s learned how to play the guitar, has ambitions to become a musician, and also has proclaimed himself a Scientologist.

Not that he ever seems to have practiced, but that''s what he would claim that he was.

Kind of, you know, self-educated himself in prison to a certain degree.

And so when he gets out of prison in 67, he was a model prisoner.

He behaved himself, you know, and seemed.

You can sort of imagine his life is going into completely different direction.

And here again, I''m going to say something kind of good about Charles Madsen, which is that he actually was a decent singer.

If you really sort of listen to some of the stuff he did.

You know, he''s not a great singer, but he could have, you know, other people got recording contracts with less talent than he had, and they could play guitar.

The Beach Boys actually do record one of his songs without him.

How would you evaluate Hitler''s painting?

On compared to Charles''s man.

Well, you''re supposed to say it''s terrible.

Okay.

Okay.

It looks average to me.

Yeah.

It''s landscape.

I mean, If you didn''t know it was Hitler, would it, would it, would it, would you, I don''t know what people will say about it.

Sorry for the distractions.

It''s just, you know, it''s just an average painter.

That''s what it was.

Something like crazy genocidal maniac paintings that you don''t have really have those.

So Manson, you could have done that.

He probably could have, you know, he made certain inroads into the music industry.

And if you hadn''t been such a weirdo, he his life could have taken a different turn.

So this is one of the questions I have.

Where did a guy who becomes, who''s an unexceptional career petty criminal, suddenly emerge into some sort of criminal mastermind, a Sven Golly, who can bend all of these people to his will and get them to go out and commit murder?

That''s a real shift that you have.

So the first thing it kind of could tell you that something odd is going on, as he gets out of prison in LA County.

And he''s on parole.

You know, parolees are supposed to have a job, not supposed to leave the jurisdiction of their parole.

He had straight for the Bay Area, violates parole right off the bat.

Two weeks later, he drifts into the parole office in the Bay Area, whereupon he should have been arrested and sent back to terminal island.

But instead, They just assigned him a parole.

I don''t know.

Maybe things were easier then in some way.

So he gets assigned a parole officer Michael Smith Michael Smith is initially handling a number of parolees, but after a while once he takes on Manson He only has one parole.

He''s supervising Charlie Manson, which is odd And he also find out that Michael Smith in addition to being a parole officer is a graduate student at the University of California studying group dynamics, especially the influence of drugs on gangs in groups, and he''s also connected to the Hay and Ashbury free clinic, which is a place where the influence of because Hay and Ashbury had lots of drugs and lots of groups.

groups.

So, you know, Charlie Manson never gets a regular job, hangs around with young girls, ex-cons, engages in criminal activity, is repeatedly arrested but nothing ever sticks for the next couple of years.

So who gets that type of thing?

Who gets it get out of jail free card in formats.

So here is what, again, this is speculation, but Manson at some point after he got out of prison is getting this treatment because he is recruited as a confidential informant.

For who?

For who?

That''s the interesting question.

So, probably not for any local police departments, my best suspicion is probably the federal Bureau of Narcotics, precursor to the DEA.

Yeah, federal paroleee, federal parole officer come graduate student in drugs and group dynamics and eventually with permission he goes back down to L.A. and what is he part of when he''s there?

Well, he''s on the fringes of the music industry.

Not so much, you know, these those the Wilson''s and elsewhere, which also brings him to the fringes of the film industry.

So one of the things if you''re sort of looking in terms of Hollywood music industry elites in the flow of, oh, and he''s also dealing in drugs and girls.

So an early version of Jeffrey Epstein.

Yeah, a mass-interracted lots of underage runaways and train them, use them also associating with biker gangs who produce the drugs, etc.

So that''s part of what.

He''s an, he''s an informant in the movement of drugs basically within the film music industries.

And he''s given pretty much a kind of free grain at that point.

What then happens in August of 1969 is that there are these murders, you know, first, Sharon Tate and her friends in the Cielo Drive.

I think everybody is probably pretty much heard that story before, And of course, the question is, why Cielo drive, why Sharon Tate for Koski and the rest of him, that he had some, Manson was familiar with the place he had been there before.

Members of the family had been there before.

So he knew where it was.

It wasn''t an easy place to find.

May the way that that house, the original house is no longer there, but the same sort of property in a house is built there.

And if you didn''t know where it was, it''s not some place.

Let''s just go for a drive in the Hollywood Hills and murder people in a house.

Well, that isn''t one that you would come across.

There are lots of connections there.

Voitek Frakowski, who was one of the people killed at the CLO Drive House, was involved in drug dealing.

That''s a possible connection between the two, probably a fairly likely one.

Probably not unfortunate, shearantate at all.

She was probably in the wrong place at the wrong time, her husband might have been, you never know.

And then the next night, after the slaughter there, which by the way, Manson is not at.

So this is one of the interesting things about it.

Charles Manson doesn''t kill any of these people.

He has crimes supposedly ordering the killings to be done.

He supposedly thought that the killings at the Tate House were sloppy.

And he was going to give everybody a crash course in how you apparently commit seemingly random murders.

So the next night he takes group of people over to the La Bianca''s house in a different section of LA.

And you''ve got Lena Rosemary, La Bianca, a guy who''s a grocer, his wife runs a dress shop, upper middle class, and they''re bound to gagged and hacked a death as at the tape residence various things like Piggy or Ritten, you know, various messages just in blood things that are supposed to look like cats paws because one of the grooves trying to be framed for this was the idea was the black panthers.

So the general story that comes out in the subsequent trial is that this was all a part of something called Helter Skelter, which Manson supposedly was an idea that that sounds like a Beatles song that''s where he got it from.

He thought the Beatles were talking to him through their music and that there was going to be an apocalyptic race war.

And this was all part of a plan to set this off.

So this is why the black panthers were trying to be implicated in this.

Although how it was supposed to do that is never really explained.

Here is what I think was really happening.

What really happened and how I think it fits together.

Before Sharon Tate and her friends or the La Bianca''s were killed, there was a murder by members of the family of some of the same people involved in the later killings of a musician, drug manufacturer by the name of Gary Hinman.

So Massin again was involved in the drug trade And Hinman made them.

He was a cook, basically.

And he brewed them up in his basement, sold the drugs to Manson, who sold them to biker gangs like the Straight Satan''s, which was one of the groups that he used, and they distributed them elsewhere.

Well, one day, the Straight Satan show up and complained that the last batch of math or whatever it was that they got from Madison, he had made some of their brothers very, very ill and they were quite unhappy about that and they wanted their $2,000 back.

Madison had gotten those drugs from Gary Hinman.

So he is unhappy and he sends Bobby Bose away and a couple of the girls over to Hinman''s place to get the money from him.

As the story is related, I think, by Susan Atkins, Hinman denied that there was anything wrong with his drugs and refused to pay up, which led to an interrogation torture session in which he was killed.

And the idea was here, what are we going to do with that?

Well, one of the other groups that Hinman had sold drugs to were, guess what, people associated with a black panther.

So we''ll leave these things up and we''ll make they will do it.

So it''s Bobby Bosele who then takes Hinman''s car and decides to drive it up the coast.

By the way with a bloody knife with Hinman''s blood and hair on it and blood on the seats in the car and then he pulls it off the road and decides to sleep it off and it gets busted.

right.

So find Hinman''s body, find Bosele and Hinman''s car with a bloody knife with him.

Yeah, he''s arrested.

So Bosele was very popular with some of the girls.

There''s consternation in the family that Bobby has been arrested.

So how can we possibly get Bobby out of jail?

Copycat killings.

So, if we go kill more people and we make it look the same, then see, body couldn''t possibly have done it.

Now, see, he just borrowed the car, yeah, okay, he stole the car, but the knife was already in it.

He didn''t have anything to do with this.

So, that, to me, makes the most sense out of what followed.

How often do people talk about that theory?

That''s an interesting theory.

Well, it''s there.

It''s just not the one that, that Boogley-Oce wanted to go with Helter''s scouter because because it was, again, it was a story that people could understand and it was sensational and it would catch on.

Also another probable issue in that was that his star witness was Linda Cassabian.

Linda Cassabian, she was present at both the Tate and La Bianca murders.

She didn''t participate in the killings according to her.

She sort of drives the car, but everybody else talked about what had happened.

Well, okay, she turns state evidence and gets total immunity, and it''s largely on her testimony that all the rest of the case is based.

Now, if you start throwing into the equation that she proclaimed her love for Bobby Bosele, and that she, according to others, was the chief proponent of the copycat killings?

Well, then that would get messy.

Now, there''s one guy at the center of this.

It''s Charles Manson.

He ordered all of this done to ignite a race war even though how would any of that do it?

Okay.

So that doesn''t make sense.

But he is nevertheless at the center of this because he''s the glue of the family, right?

He exerts a tremendous amount of psychological control over them.

How was he able to do that?

Sorry to interrupt.

Like what?

because he said he was a petty criminal.

It does seem he was pretty prolific in his petty crimes.

Like he did a lot of them.

He had a lot of access to LSD.

Okay, okay.

Which he started getting at the free clinic in San Francisco.

So lots of it floating around.

Some descriptions of the family at Spawn Ranch is that people were basically taking acid on a daily basis, which by the way was also a potential problem with Linda Kisebi in this testimony since she also admitted to being high most of the time and also thinking she was a witch.

All right, so you want to put her?

Okay, where do you want to go with that?

See, if Manson wasn''t Manson, if he hadn''t acted like such a complete...

If he hadn''t actually acted like the crazed hippy psycho goofball that Bugliosi painted him as being, then Cassabian''s testimony wouldn''t have been as strong because you could.

I mean, the first thing against her is you''ve gotten immunity for telling the story of the prosecution once.

Yeah, that''s a little iffy.

And we wouldn''t even bring in the witch and the drugs and being in love with Bobby Boseley, aren''t.

So if Manson had been dressed like you sitting there in a suit and tie an inel and hand it behaved himself and spoken normally, things might, this isn''t to say that he wasn''t guilty as hell.

So what he supposedly did was to inspire all of these killings.

And I think that''s probably, you know, sort of beginning with the Hinman killing.

He told them to go over there and get the money, one way or the other.

I don''t know whether there''s clear where they told him if you don''t get the money, kill him, but Hinman''s dead.

And then, it might also see the value in terms of having copycat killings as a way of throwing off any other kind of blame.

The other story you get is that one of the people who had lived at the Cielo House for Sharon Tate was before, who was a record producer by the name of Terry Melcher.

Melcher supposedly is the general story goes head welched on a deal with Manson in terms of a record contract.

He screwed over Manson in some sort of a record deal and Manson wanted to get revenge and sent him to kill everybody in the house.

Which again doesn''t make him much of a sense.

One, Manson knew that Melcher wasn''t living there anymore.

He probably knew where Melcher was living.

If he wanted to get Melcher, he could have found him.

It wasn''t that difficult to do.

And so that''s, it''s not Revenge on Terry Melcher that drew him there.

He was familiar with the house, so if the idea was to simply commit random killings that would throw, it would muddy the whole waters with the henman killing, then you might pick some place you knew of, you knew the place with the running out there would be someone there you really didn''t care.

And the same way that the lobbyonka seemed to have been, Manson was familiar with that because it supposedly had been the scene of creepy crawling.

This is little interesting things that this fan will be taught to do, creepy crawling.

Yes, when you sneak into somebody''s house at night While they''re there a sleep or when they''re not there and you move things around So when they get up in the morning or they come home They''ll suddenly notice that someone has been in their house, which will Freak them out, which is the whole point of that But it doesn''t seem like the murder or the creepy crawling was the creepy crawling made me but it doesn''t seem like the murder other, like some of the other people you''ve covered like the zodiac killer, the murder is the goal.

Maybe there''s some psychopathic kind of artistry to the murder that the zodiac killer had and the messaging behind that.

But it seems like with the, at least the way you''re describing it with Charles Manson family, the murder was just, they just had a basic disregard for human life and the murder was a consequence of operating in the drug underworld.

So Manson set up a kind of base, I think, called the spawn movie wrench, which was an old movie wrench out on the northwest edge of L.A. And they just kind of camped out there.

He used the girls in particular squeaky from to get the owner or operator.

I think George spawned to let them hang out there, and basically she slept with him and he was perfectly happy to let them hang out.

They also had a place out of the desert that they had.

They dealt in credit card fraud, stolen cars.

It was kind of a shop shop that they ran out of the place.

So you had a fairly good little criminal gig going, which with the protection he had probably would, the one thing they couldn''t cover him on was murder.

So you think there was, if he was an informer, you think there was still a connection between DA, FBI, CIA, whatever, with him throughout this until you come to murder?

The real question is, there is a book written on this by Tom O''Neill, Colqueos.

And not a certain thing.

It''s the easiest thing to get through.

There''s a lot of material there.

I don''t think O''Neill necessarily knows what to make of some of the stuff he came up with.

But he does a very good job of sort of demolishing the whole Buglio scenario.

And one of the people he mentions is a name that I had run into elsewhere, and so I really paid attention to it when I saw it again, and the name is Reeve Whitson.

Reeve Whitson shows up on the fringes, even though he has no judicial function.

He sort of hangs around Booly Aussie in the prosecution, he''s some sort of advice.

He''s just kind of there.

In the same way that he was one of these guys, you know, he grew his hair kind of long or bell bottoms hung around the music Community and elsewhere in Hollywood, but no one could tell you exactly what he did I Know what he did later, but a decade later he shows up as a CIA officer in Central America Hmm So, Reeve Wittsen, later in his career at least, is CIA.

What was he in 1969?

What is he doing in this?

The other thing about it is he appears to have been the person who called this little question when the bodies at C.H.L.O. drive are discovered.

So the general story is that Sharon Tate''s housekeeper shows up around 8.30 in the morning flies a bloody scene and goes screaming next door But there was another fellow who knew I think the owner of the house is a photographer Lesson may be Hattami.

He gets a call earlier in the morning saying that there''d been murders there And the person he would call it''s calling him is Reeve Whitson So someone had been at the house Before the bodies were discovered and they had not called the police So I don''t know what''s going on there, but he''d say It''s a curious kind of of situation And Manson in a lot of ways just kind of self immolates himself I mean, his behavior at the trial is bizarre, it''s threatening, it''s disruptive, you know, he''s got his girls out on the street carving X''s in their forehead, carrying knives.

One of the attorneys, initially his attorney, Ron Hughes, becomes Van Halton''s attorney, and he figures out that the three girls supposedly on Charlie''s insistence are going to confess, and they''re confessed that it was all their idea and Charlie had nothing to do with it.

He wasn''t like this because his defense for her is that she was under his influence and therefore not responsible for her own actions.

He was having psychic control so he refuses to go along with it.

There''s a break in the trial.

He goes camping up in the mountains with some friends.

Disappears during a rainstorm and then some months later his decomposed remains are found.

Now rumors, always the rumors.

Okay.

What would history be without rumors?

Hell that, uh, he members of the family, they were, they were, they were pissed off at Ron Hughes because he messed up Charlie''s idea to get him off and so they killed him.

Maybe they did.

Maybe he drowned.

That''s, that''s absolutely impossible to say.

You got that kind of story.

There''s a guy named Juan Flynn, who was an employee at the spawn ranch, didn''t like Manson.

He held Manson responsible for the murder of his boss.

He would testify that Manson told him that he had ordered all the killings, and that Manson also admitted that he had killed 35 people.

Maybe he did, on the other hand, Juan Flynn didn''t like him, And he had no other than his word, had no real proof of what he was saying.

So, please understand me in this case, is that unlike some people who argue that Charles Manson got a raw deal, I don''t think that''s the case.

I think that he influenced tremendous influence over the people there through drugs, through who sex was another frequent component in it.

He had a real whammy over a lot of these people''s minds.

I''m not sure how, that still kind of puzzles me.

He was a scrawny guy, and he wasn''t physically intimidating.

I mean, even a lot of women wouldn''t be physically intimidated by him, but he nonetheless had this real psychological power, and if you look around him, the male followers he had wasn''t a really big guy.

So he could get people to do what he wanted.

And again, to me, the simplest explanation for this is that it began with the henman killing and probably on Manson''s instigation, the others were copycat killings to throw off what was going on.

That would, if I was a cop, that''s what I would focus on because that seems to make the most sense.

It''s still as fascinating that he''s able to have that much psychological control over of those people without having a very clear ideology.

So it''s a cult.

Yes, the great focus on Charlie the leader, the excessive devotion.

But there''s not an ideology behind that, like something like Scientology or some kind of religious or some kind of, I don''t know, utopian ideology, nothing like this.

No, I think that Manson again was essentially a criminal.

get a sociopathic mindset and he''s hit upon a pretty good deal.

Yeah, but like, how do people convince anybody of anything with the, with the call, usually you have either an ideology or you have maybe personal relations like you said sex and drugs, but underneath that, can you really keep people with sex and drugs?

You have to kind of convince them that you love them in some deep sense, like there''s a, like a commune of love.

You have a lot of people there in the cult.

They have some sort of we like to call dysfunctional families.

A lot of the females in particular seem to have come from, you know, more or less middle-class families, but those are full of dysfunction.

You know, their parents didn''t love them.

There are semi-runaways and now they had this whole family.

A lot of the younger women had children.

You know, some of them by Manson, some of them by the others, they sort of bonded together.

And again, we return to that pull towards belonging that gets us humans into trouble.

So it does seem that there were a few crimes around this time.

So zodiacular.

Well, California, I''m from, so I remember this period vividly.

So by the way, the Tate La Bionca killings occurred on my birthday, the year I graduated from high school.

So I remember this.

Happy birthday.

A term which has been used for that, there''s a writer with the name of Todd Wood who''s toyed, I wish I''d come up with this killer for ya.

And which is just sort of a chronicle of the serial killers and disappearances in the late 60s and 70s.

So you''ve got the zodiac, you''ve got otherwise, I mean, you know, I hate to say it.

I''m not trying to be flippin'' about, but I mean young female hitchhikers were disappearing an alarming rate in Northern California.

There are bodies that have never been attributed.

something that the zodiacs victims, but it was a dangerous time.

Edmund Kemper, you know, the co-ed killer was was another one.

There were a lot of creepy psychopaths running around.

I don''t know whether it was something in the water or what was going on, but it was a menacing in some cases.

Hitchhiking, especially if you were alone and female, was not something you wanted to do in much of the Golden State, certainly not if around the Bay Area.

So, a lot of these strange sort of killings that we''re going on, the Zodiac is one of those things where you have these people who have theories about it.

And if you don''t share their theory then, you know, you''re part of the problem in some form or another.

So I''m not sure, for instance, the zodiac killings roll committed by the same person.

I think there might have been multiple people involved.

And, you know, the first killings are all of couples.

It''s very sort of clear that they, I remember in my examination of it, one of the things I was looking at specific, you know, what else is there to say about the zodiac killing.

So what I was going to look at is that there are all of these accusations that there is an occult aspect to it.

There was some sort of ritualistic aspect.

So I looked at different things, locations, victims, phases of the moon.

That''s always worth looking at.

I didn''t find much correspondence in any of those.

In one of the killings, I think the one at Lake Berriessa, he does appear in this kind of weird hooded costume.

He''s got his symbol, the sort of compass or aiming, rectical circle, with a cross through it, it can read a variety of things.

He used guns and he used knives, but he certainly had to think for couples, except in the last of the killings, wishes of a cab driver in downtown San Francisco, go, who he shoots in full view of witnesses, which is completely atypical.

And also when he was stabbing the victims, it doesn''t seem like he was very good at it.

Or if the goal was to kill them, he wasn''t very good at it because some of them survived.

Yeah, he doesn''t, he''s not particularly thorough about it.

He seems to have had much more, more of the violence seems to be directed at the females in the males.

So there''s a couple questions to ask here.

First of all, did people see his face?

There''s a composite drawing of his face, which I think is based upon the Stein killing, the cab driver killing, where there were people who saw him or who claimed that they saw him.

The other ones were all when it was fairly dark.

Right.

I''m not sure that anyone else got to look at his face.

The one that occurred in the daylight at Barrie S.A. He was wearing a mask.

So there''s something in common initially in the targeting of victims, which doesn''t in the last case.

Then after that there''s just the different cases of where there''s a pretty good case to be made of a woman who claims I think she was she and her a small child were picked up.

Her car broke down.

She got a flat tire.

She was picked up by this guy right, who she got a very sort of strange vibe from, who eventually just let her go.

Well, you know, that might have been the Zodiac, it might not have been.

You do this kind of rigorous look, saying like, okay, what is the actual facts that we know?

Like, reduce it to the thing that we know for sure.

And in speaking about his motivation, and he said that he was collecting souls.

Souls for the afterlife.

For the afterlife.

That''s kind of a culty.

Yeah, I mean, that''s what I believe is it the Vikings or the Romans, they believe this in battle.

You''re essentially making sacrificial victims and they will be your ghostly servants in the afterlife.

Do you think he actually believed that?

Who knows?

I mean, here''s the question.

was he making that up just to be scary?

Or is that what his actual, that''s what he''s saying his motivation is.

So let''s take him at face value rather than trying to wish that into the cornfield, that is to get rid of it.

Let''s just take it to face.

So he''s claiming that he''s killing these people in order to acquire slave servants in the afterlife.

He will subsequently go on to claim many more victims.

I''m not sure if 44, eventually he will have, before he just kind of vanishes.

One of the really interesting clues to me when I was looking at that case, which I didn''t find anybody else that tended to make much of it up, is that it all has to do with this kind of Halloween card that he sends to the press in San Francisco.

And it''s talking about sort of rope by gun, by fire, and there''s this whole sort of wheel.

You know, it''s like the zodiacs.

But what the West is drawn from, where he got this from, is from a Tim Holt Western comic book, published in the 1951, and you see the same thing in the cover.

It''s wheel of fortune, but with different forms of grizzly death on it and all of the things that he mentioned are shown on the cover of this So whoever put together that card saw that comic book That''s kind of an interesting clue.

So does that mean he''s a comic book collector?

When would he have I mean that is one and also before he got the idea from So he''s incorporating these things from the then there are of course his codes which people have you know Which aren''t all that difficult to decipher or probably because they weren''t meant to be The other thing that you find often with Serial or psychopathic killers.

Those are toying with the press.

I mean this goes all the way back to Jack the Ripper Now they get attention And then he just disappears course.

Why do you think he was never caught?

I think they knew it would look for.

There''s nothing much to go on.

I mean, there was a guy who was long as suspect and then eventually he tested his DNA and find it didn''t match any of the things that they''d found.

Again, it goes back to, I''m not even sure that it''s one person who''s responsible for all of them.

Well, that''s one of the interesting things you kind of bring up here and our discussion of Manson inspires this, but there does seem to be a connection, a shared inspiration between several killers here, the zodiac, the son of Sam later, and the monster of Florence.

So is it possible there''s some kind of like an underworld that is connecting these people?

Well, take the zodiac and you had his claim that he''s collecting souls for the afterlife.

There are other things that are occultish connected to that.

He may have picked some of the killing sites due to their physical location, to their position in a particular place.

If you look at the son of Sam Case, of course David Berkowitz will on and off claim that But he was part of a satanic cult that was carrying out, again, these killings, mostly of couples and young women similar to the Zodiac, and that he had only committed some of them and was witnesses that others.

And that has really created the whole idea that, yes, there is this some kind of satanic cult which engages in ritual murders.

Then if you go all the way to Florence, you''ve got murders who go on and off for a long period of time, again focusing on couples in isolated areas, which Italian prosecutors ultimately tried to connect to some kind of satanic cult, although I''m not sure they ever made a particularly strong case for that, but that element comes up in all three of them.

So you can, with a little imagination, argue that those similarities, that those things should come up in each of those cases in different places either suggest that oddly enough psychopathic criminals all sort of thinking the same way, or that there is some sort of higher element involved in this, that there''s some kind of common inspiration.

Here you come back to something similar we were talking before about do pedophiles exist, do pedophile.

I''ll say so do do satanic cults exist.

Well, they do.

Okay, there was one of my hometown, apparently quite harmless.

As far as I know, they never did anything.

you know, but there are people who, you know, robes, here we come again, robes cut the head off a check-in, naked woman is an alter, you know, you can get off on that, I suppose, if that''s your thing.

So, profess sataness exist, satanic cults exist, serial killers exist, ritual murders exist.

Are those things necessarily connected?

No. Could they be connected?

Yes.

Okay, there''s there''s nothing don''t ever tell me that something is just too crazy for people to do because that''s That''s crazy talk You''ve studied secret societies.

You''ve gave a lot of amazing lectures on secret societies It''s fascinating to look at human history through the lens of secret societies because they''ve permeated all of human history You''ve talked about form everything from the Knights Templar to Illuminati to Freemasons like we brought up Freemasons lasted a long time and Illuminati as you''ve talked about in its sort of main form lasted a short time but it''s legend.

Never gone away.

Never gone away.

So maybe like Illuminati is a really interesting one.

Who?

What was that?

Well, the Illuminati that we know started in the 1776.

In fact, you founded by a professor, Adam Weissacht.

It wasn''t initially called the Illuminati, because that''s not really the name of the organization.

It was called the Order Perfectabilists.

Apparently that changed.

Weissacht would say things like never let our organization be known under its real name anywhere, which leaves wondering what''s its real name.

So Illuminati is simply the plural of Illuminatus, which means one who was illuminated, one who has seen the light.

So in Roman times, Christian converts were Illuminati because they had seen the light.

Anyone who thinks, and there have been organizations called Illuminati, the term is not trademarked, not copyrighted.

Anybody who thinks they''ve seen the light about anything is an illuminati.

So it defines nothing.

The symbol of the order was an owl, which interestingly enough is almost identical to the owl, which is the emblem of the Bohemian club.

Oh boy.

Make of that what you will.

I don''t make that much out of it because one owl looks pretty much like another owl to me, but compare them.

You know, you got to kind of wonder about this a little, just a little thing.

Maybe there''s some kind of connection there.

So what that supposedly has to do with the connection to the goddess Minerva and the owl was sacred to her and the order and the order was the Minerval, the person who was brought in.

The number of levels changed over time.

There was a higher level for the order that people at the lower level didn''t know about.

Pretty typical for this.

But the thing about Vice-Helft was that he was quite, he was a, uh, luminous correspondent with members with his Illuminati, both during the time that it legally existed in Bavaria, and later on.

So Vice-Helft himself lives, I think, until 1830, dies in Goethe, which was ruled by an Illuminati prince, and so on.

Nothing ever happens to these.

No, no luminonis ever put the death or arrested in prison for any period of time.

What happens is that their plan, well, what was his plan?

His plan was to essentially replace all existing religions and governments in the world with one world order governed by the Illuminati.

So to do this, you had to subvert and destroy all the existing order.

And, you know, the purpose for this is to we wish to make men happy and free, but first we must make them good.

All right.

So that''s what the order is all about.

Of course, he also said things like, Oh man, is there nothing that you won''t believe?

Okay, so myth would be used in that.

Also thought women should be brought into it.

Yet a rather interesting view about that was that we should appeal to women.

And part because women have a chip on their shoulder because they''re left out of things.

So we should appeal to their vanity on that point and offer that in the future all things will be open and they will be emancipated.

So we should hold out the prospect to female emancipation to attract them because he argued in the short term there''s no better way to influence men than through women.

Get women on our side by promising the emancipation, but he made sure we''ll never actually deliver it to them because the future world will be a boys club.

So he talks about these things fairly openly and this is where you get this idea of some sort of a new world order which is to be based upon the destruction of the existing order.

So there are those who argue that there is a trail of descent that leads from Visehoff''s Illuminati to the Communist Manifesto and, in fact, Communism itself, that Marxism was simply a further restating of this idea.

And you can draw some sort of tinnitus.

I mean, the idea never entirely goes away.

The Bavarian government gets a hold of the orders in her texts.

So the story is there, deliver to them.

I think that Vice-Half gave them to him.

I think he engineered the exposure of his order because it gave him publicity.

By being exposed in Bavaria, you gained great renown and they continued to recruit after this.

and the Bavarian government actually bans the Illuminati four different times.

Why?

Because apparently the first three times didn''t work.

So the fourth one does, you can notice that it''s like papal bans on free masonry and they just go on and on and on because this clearly isn''t working.

And you actually highlight the difference between speaking of publicity that there''s a difference a gene of visibility and transparency that a secret society could be visible, it could be known about, it could be quite popular, but you could still have a secrecy within it.

You have no idea what''s going on inside.

Yeah.

It''s like a black box.

If I said a black box on this table, we can see that there''s a black box.

What''s in the black box?

A cat?

Who knows?

In fact, the secrecy might be the very thing that makes it even more popular.

Adam, vice sounds again.

There is no more, more think convincing than a concealed mystery.

give people a concealed mystery in the fuss.

So we need to make the order mysterious for that exact reason, always hold out the possibility that knowledge, special knowledge that no mere mortals have other than you will have that way.

So he senses a lot of things, the use of vanity and ego to recruit people, to influence both men and women, it''s quite sophisticated.

And as you might expect from a professor of canon law trained by Jesuits.

So I certainly don''t think that it ceased when it was banned in Bavaria because everybody just scatters and goes elsewhere, like Paris, and then you have the French Revolution.

So the idea of the Illuminati to put it crudely, the branding is a really powerful one.

And so it makes sense that it can, there''s a thread connecting it to this day, that a lot of organizations, a lot of secret societies can sort of adopt the brand.

Anybody can call it, you can go and form a club and call it the Illuminati.

And if you''re effective at it, I think it does attract Is the chicken or the egg but powerful people tend to have gigantic egos and people gigantic egos tend to like the exclusivity of secret societies and so like there''s There''s a it''s a gravitational force that pulls powerful people to the society exclusive only certain and you also notice something goes back to when we''re talking about much earlier when we''re talking about intelligence member mice ego.

He''s of recruitment and control.

That''s a great Achilles heel in human beings, the exploitation of ego.

And of course, if we go back to the conversation of intelligence agencies, it would be very efficient and beneficial for intelligence agencies to infiltrate the secret societies, because that''s where the powerful people are.

Or the secret societies to infiltrate the intelligence agency.

Oh boy.

Well, I mean, I did this actually in all the lectures.

I kind of had a sense that intelligence agencies themselves are kind of secret societies, right?

Well, it comes down, I give you my definition of secret societies, but they come down to one is that generally, their existence isn''t secret.

It''s what they do is secret.

It''s what''s in the box, as opposed to the existence of the box.

So one of the most important criteria is that they are self-selecting.

You just don''t join.

They pick you.

They decide whether or not you''re going to admit you, and oftentimes they will sort of recruit you.

Once you have been recruited, you have to pass tests and initiations.

and you also have to swear oaths of loyalty.

Those are always very, very critical.

So broadly speaking, what interests into an intelligent organization does, they decide whether you get in, you just automatically hit the job, you have to pass tests, one allied detector test, for instance.

Feel training tests, the whole variety of tests, and then you''re sworn to secrecy.

You never talk about what you do.

Ever, or there will be dire consequences.

So the method is very much the same, and also this idea of creating a kind of insular group.

Now, the organization is us, and everyone else is outside of that.

We are guardians of special knowledge.

See, this is the time to think that we generally happen if you question whatever any kind of intelligence agency did.

Well, we know things that you don''t.

Why?

Because we''re the organization that knows things.

We collect information.

We know the secrets.

We guard the secrets.

Therefore, if we tell you, you must believe us.

I have this sense that there are very powerful secret societies operating today, and we don''t really know or understand them.

And the conspiracy theories in spirit might have something to them, but are actually factually not correct.

It''s like, you know, an effective, powerful secret society or intelligence agencies He''s not going to let you know anything.

It doesn''t want you to know, right?

They''ll probably mislead you if you can send him close.

So I think, you know, the question is, what''s the most powerful or important secret society, probably the one you don''t know about, one that doesn''t advertise its existence, the one which is never known anywhere under its real name?

You''ve got things like the Bohemian Club.

up.

You''ve got the builder burgers, which is in other sort of, you know, formed in the 1950s.

Largely the creation of a guy by the name of Josef Rettinger.

Polish, mysterious, appears at a note where a schemer for years.

A man expelled from Britain, France, and the United States at one point or another.

Long active in the Mexican labor movement.

Okay.

Okay, Reddinger is mysterious figure.

In fact, I think there was even a book written about him called Eminence Grease, great Eminence, the frontman for the builder burgers was Prince Berenhardt of the Netherlands, who was at one point in Nazi, and then a Dutch freedom fighter.

Take your pick.

But Reddinger is the moving hand behind the whole thing, and I''ll be damp I''m trying to figure out who Reddinger is.

So the idea is that, well, you get like influential people in media, business, politics, and you bring them together just to talk, to try to find common answers or common questions.

It''s all very much Western European, I mean, it''s all very closely connected to NATO.

the whole concept of a kind of Atlantisist world, which is essentially the Anglo-American combine combined with Western Europe.

But you''ve got a bunch of these things.

I mean, the Castle and Foreign relations is very similar to that.

And the builder, Burgers, is an overlap with the Bohemian Club, and then you''ve got the Penae Circle, or Lescerco, which is more military, but also linked to the so-called secret gladiolium.

The idea of the Soviets over around Western Europe, there would be a stay behind organization called Gladiol, there would be these freedom fighters.

So the question I have about that is that how many secret organizations do you need?

I mean, why all these separate groups, which often seem to have the same people into them?

Yeah, there''s a, and the closer I look, the more I wonder the same question we asked about the Russian intelligence agencies is, where is the center of power?

It seems to be very hard to figure out.

Does the secrecy scare you?

Well, I guess on one level, I''m comforted that there''s somebody actually making decisions.

as opposed to today.

I mean, what do you want?

Do you want chaos or do you want everything kind of rigidly controlled?

And I don''t put much stock in the idea that there actually is some small group of people running everything because if they were, you would operate more efficiently.

I do think that there are various disparate groups of people who think that they''re running things or try to.

And that''s what concerns me more than anything else.

Well, I had to go back to them again, because if you''re bringing up, you go back to the Nazis, they had their whole idea about a new world order and they only had 12 years to do it and look what a mess they made.

I mean, look at the damage, the physical damage that can be done, by an idea inspiring a relatively small group of people controlling a nation.

Based upon some sort of racial or ideological fantasy that has no real basis in reality and yet guides their actions, it''s this differentiation that I always make and I would try to get across the students between always be clear about what you know and what you believe.

You don''t know many things.

You know your name, you know when you were born, you probably know who your father is, but that''s not absolute unless you''ve had a DNA test and only if you trust DNA a test.

So you know who your mother is?

You believe this man is your father.

Why?

Because your mother told you it was.

So you believe things generally because someone has told you this is to be true, but you don''t really know for sure.

Well, because we know so little, we tend to go by beliefs.

So we believe believe in this.

We believe in that.

You believe that your cult leaders is the answer to everything.

And it seems to be very, very easy to get people to believe things.

And then what happens is that whether or not those beliefs have any real basis in reality, they begin to influence your actions.

So here again, regrettably in some ways to bring it back to the Nazis.

What were the Nazis convinced of?

They were convinced that Jews were basically evil aliens.

That''s what it comes down to.

They weren''t really humans.

There''s some sort of evil contamination, which we must eradicate.

And they set out to do that.

And they were sure that there''s just a few problems that can be solved.

And once you solve them, that you have this beautiful utopia where everything would be just perfect.

It''d be great and we can just get there and I think it''s really strong belief and a global utopia It just never goes right It''s well there seems like impossible to know for some reason not long ago.

I was listening on YouTube to old wobbly songs The work of the world I don''t know why I know there was a whole album of wobbly songs But, and there was one of them called commonwealth of toil and it''s like most of them they''re sort of taken from gospel songs and it''s talking about in the future, you know, how wonderful everything will be in the commonwealth of toil that will be.

And these are, you know, revolutionary leftists, in this case, wobblies, but nonetheless, it''s like a prayer for communism, everything.

Now, in the future, everything will be good because the earth will be shared by the toilers and, you know, from each of the abilities of each to his knee.

And it''s this kind of sweet little song in some way.

But I''m just sort of imagining this, you know, if I was going to stage that, I''d have like this choir of children singing it with a huge hammer and sickle behind them.

Because that''s what it''s combining.

And you can think that the sentiments that express in that song, which, you know, are legitimate in some way of all the whores that that then leads to.

It is fascinating about humans, a beautiful idea on paper, an innocent little idea about a utopian future can lead to so much suffering, that''s so much destruction.

And totally the unintended consequences as you see the law of unintended consequences and we learn from it I mean, that''s why history is important.

We''ll learn from it.

Hopefully.

Do we?

Slowly or slow learn.

I''m unconvinced of that, but perhaps is speaking of unconvinced What gives you hope?

if a human beings are still here Maybe expanding out into the cosmos a thousand, five thousand, ten thousand years from now, what gives you hope about that future, about even being a possible future about it happening?

Most people are cooperative and kind most of the time.

And that''s one of those things that can usually be dependent upon and usually you''ll get back to what you put into it.

Another thing that I have like a weird fascination of watching are people who have meltdowns on airplanes.

Because that''s just bizarre.

That''s the people who will, you know, there''s some sort of psychotic break that occurs and they''ll, and it''s always going to end the same way.

The cops are going to come on a drag you off the plane.

Now, true, they''ll, and you''re going to inconvenience everybody there.

And usually at some point they don''t care about that.

That''s the one little sense of power that they have.

So they have some sort of sense of powerlessness.

And if their only way of power is just to piss off everybody else on that plane, they''re going to go ahead and do it, even though it''s going to lead nowhere for them.

And they''re similar, sometimes psychological behavior in traffic.

Oh, the road rage thing.

The road rage, yeah.

It''s fascinating.

And I bet that most, there again, those are all people who up to some point were cooperative even and kind and polite.

And then they snap.

So those are all part of the human makeup as well.

But also part of the human makeup difference between humans and chimps is the ability to get together cooperating a mass scale over an idea, create things like the Roman Empire didn''t laws that prevent us and protect us from crazy human behavior, manifestations of a man''s and type of human beings are just weird animals.

It''s not getting around.

It''s just completely peculiar.

I''m not sure that we''re all together natural.

But I think we are all together beautiful.

There is something magical about humans and I hope humans stay here even as we get advanced robots walking around everywhere.

More and more intelligent robots that claim to have consciousness that claim they love you that increasingly take over our world.

I hope this magical things that makes us human still persists.

Well, let us hope so.

Right, you''re an incredible person.

So so so much fascinating work and it''s really an I''ve never had anybody ask me is is many interesting questions Thank you so much for listening to this conversation with Rick Spence to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description.

And now let me leave you some words from John F Kennedy.

The very word, secrecy, is repugnant in a free and open society, and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, the secret oaths, and the secret proceedings.

We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.

Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.', '2024-10-31 05:21:38', '2024-10-31 05:21:38');

Hey, it''s Jack, host of the show.

When I was a kid, I got an ant farm from my birthday.

It''s like two panes of glass with some sand in between and you can watch the ants dig tunnels and go about their day.

It was really cool, but when you get the ant farm, it doesn''t contain any ants.

You have to order the ants and they''re mailed to you.

And the first thing I thought about when I was a kid and I heard about this was, wait a minute, I can mail ants to anyone I want.

And I think that is basically the hacker mindset to completely ignore some things intended use and find new ways to employ it.

Okay, today we''re gonna have a chat with someone so infamous, he has his own worm named after him, the Sammy worm.

That''s right.

Today we''re talking with Sammy Camcar.

Sammy is a hacker in almost every way.

He does things he''s not supposed to do.

He''s the kind of guy that thinks buttons are toys and you push them for fun just to see what they do, which often ends up breaking something.

I was never malicious person at all.

So all this hacking, all of this exploitation, it''s really about a puzzle.

To me, this was all a puzzle, a really fun puzzle.

There''s a lot of reasons to call Sammy infamous.

But to tell his story, we need to go back to his childhood.

When I was nine years old, my mom bought me my first computer.

So I spent everything she had, so I''d have something to do during the summer.

She knew I lived computers.

I''d always go to the library with her or to her university and go and just spend all day at the library on the computers that they had.

And immediately I went online and I started searching for the ex files, which is obviously the best TV show of the time.

I found some message boards and that quickly became really frustrating to after a refresh and a wait for people to update that message board.

So then I found something called IRC, Internet Relay Chat.

And I jumped on, I went into a channel and said, hey, he wants a chat about the ex files.

and immediately someone told me, get out.

And I''m thinking, that''s weird.

This is like a random person I don''t know on the internet and they''re telling me to do something?

No. So I told the guy, no.

And then he said, you have 10 seconds to get out of this chapter.

And I said, no.

And 10 seconds later, the brand new computer that my mom spent everything on crashes.

I had a blue screen and I freaked out.

I had no idea what to do.

do.

I pulled the power from the back of the computer.

I waited about half an hour for all the bad stuff to get out of the computer.

I think that''s what you''re supposed to do.

And then I plugged it back in.

Unfortunately, it came back up.

Everything was fine.

But really with your adrenaline still rushing through my veins, I was thinking that is the coolest thing ever.

How do I do that?

From that point forward, Sammy was addicted to computers.

This was so fascinating to him.

He wanted to understand how this had been possible.

So he began studying computers and practicing programming.

Since he now had a computer at home, he got into video games too.

Counter-strike was his favorite game.

You know, the first person shooter, he played it a lot.

He was addicted to it.

It was fun.

I mean, it was a ton of fun.

I''ve had a clan and I was playing with a bunch of friends in high school and I remember just one day I was playing and I heard some footsteps.

My computer has two speakers, you know, one on the left side, one on the right side.

So some stereo sound and I hear some footsteps coming from the right speaker and then I hear them panning to the left speaker so that immediately tells me oh there''s someone behind me because I can''t see them in my visual field of view in the game.

So immediately I''m like wait, that means someone is behind me in the game.

This is a live person, someone else on the internet playing Counter Strike with me, but I can''t see them in my radar, which means they''re on the opposing team, so I wondered right then, couldn''t I really use that information, that sound information, on the computer itself?

I''m sure that person killed me pretty quickly, but afterwards I exited Counter Strike, and I started looking into how can I pull that information?

What''s telling the computer to play footsteps on the right speaker, rather than left speaker, because that means there''s positional information there that someone is on the right side versus the left side.

And sure enough, I started learning about packet sniffing and then memory injection and intercepting function calls within the DLLs of CounterStrike itself and intercepting basically everything between the binary, the CounterStrike executable and the DLLs that it used so that I could intercept things like footsteps.

And once I hooked that function, I was then able to get exact coordinates of everyone, because everyone''s footsteps is actually being sent to you.

At least within some range, you will then get that, and that''s just telling your computer where to play the sound.

But that location is exactly where that person''s located.

At that point, I started using OpenGL at the time, and just drawing where the user is on the map in a little heads-up display and a little radar.

And then I started jumping into writing counter-strike cheats software.

That was a lot of fun.

Where were some of the cheats you could do?

Just writing aim bots, so being automatically aiming at people, being able to make any smoke bomb or smoke grenade or flashbang, just make those transparent to me.

So I could go into a room that I knew is full of opposing team members and throw in a flashbang.

And they''re all going to see white for three seconds and I''m going to run in there and see absolutely nothing because I''ve hooked that function and said do nothing.

Just return out.

You know, do a return before you actually do any of the visualization to sort of wipe my screen.

and little things like that became really fun.

I couldn''t actually modify my health that was controlled by this server.

So I couldn''t actually make myself invincible, adding zoom to every weapon.

So weapons that didn''t normally have zoom or might have like a scope on them.

So you lose a lot of the screen because it''s now blacked out.

I would just remove those.

There''s no reason that it''s green to zoom blacked out.

I would remove that.

There''s no reason that zoom should be better in one weapon than not the other.

So I had to zoom to all weapons.

And this is all totally unfair.

and pretty quickly it actually became not fun at all.

Like all of the fun of the game went away entirely because all of a sudden it was practically god mode.

Sammy released the Counter Strike cheats as open source software.

He was beginning to get bored playing the game and then punk buster came out and punk buster is a program that''s designed to scan the memory to see if anyone is cheating in the game and punk buster stopped Sammy from using his cheats.

But now the new game was for Sammy to try to circumvent whatever punk buster was using to detect him.

All of a sudden this game was fun again, because I was no longer playing the game.

I was now playing against these engineers on punk buster.

They were doing their own memory inspection.

They were looking for my process.

They were doing all sorts of things to stop my cheats and other people''s cheats as well.

And that became fun.

At that point I was probably 15 years old.

So it''s so attached to this that I stopped going to high school and I started updating my cheats because this was just so fun and it would be cat and mouse.

So I would release a new version that defeated their software and two days later they would release a new version and then I would have to figure out what do they do, how do they figure it out.

And that was like training.

It was sort of very rapid training in how does at the very least software and networking work.

And I think I probably learned a ton just during that short stint when I was writing this cheats software.

at 16, you dropped out of high school, what did you do after that?

I wasn''t good at school.

I didn''t care about most classes, so I did not do well.

It was not a good learner.

No one ever taught me how to learn something.

I think that was something that I learned later in life.

I just wish there were tools that were taught at school for me.

I think I would have been a much better student.

However, if I''m enjoying something, then I will absolutely learn it.

I''ll spend all my time on it.

I''m still not necessarily a fast learner like I''ve always known that people can pick up stuff much faster than me But if there''s something I enjoy then I''m just gonna spend all my time on it and you know, I''m very persistent Sammy was living at home with his mom in Los Angeles at the time She had recently lost her job and now that she was home more often She noticed Sammy wasn''t going to school and told him if he''s not gonna go to school He needs to get a job to help pay the rent so Sammy started applying for any job he thought he could get.

I got an email out of the blue from a company in San Diego and said, hey, we saw your cheat software, your camera strike stuff.

And will you be willing to contract and just write code for us remotely?

And I was blown away.

I was like, wait, someone will pay me to write code.

Like, I thought this was just useful for basically writing cheat software.

Like, I had no idea that you could use it for other things.

I mean, it was obvious that you could sort of program things, but I just know someone would pay me money to do that.

So I was really, really fortunate in getting that email and I started working with them and just remotely writing code for them and they never met me.

I mean, never even talked on the phone.

It was just all over the email.

And they said, hey, do you want to move to San Diego and work full time with us?

And I said absolutely.

So I took my mom''s car and I just drove down and I met them and I think they were kind of weirded out because they didn''t expect a 15 year old to show up.

and they weren''t even sure if that was legal and I was like oh no don''t worry I looked into it it''s totally legal here''s a work permit that I got from my school which is really just a work permit I had forged and printed out and I just started working with this company down in San Diego and that was really cool and that allowed me to support myself and my mom and she continued to live in LA but I got to start my own life down there which is really great.

That is incredible.

And San Diego, as a teenager, Sammy was working as a programmer, but eventually took on the responsibilities of a systems administrator.

He was making pretty good money for his age, then someone in LA tried to recruit him to work at a startup, and this was the deal, quit your job and come work for us.

Initially, we can''t pay you, but you can have some equity in the company and sleep on a founder''s couch while the startup gets off the ground.

And I said, oh, thanks for that offer now.

Thank you.

And he said, well, what do you want to do with your life?

What do you want to do the next few years?

I thought that was a really good question.

I honestly had not thought about it.

This is not something I normally think about.

And I thought about it for a while.

And I was like, well, I want to learn how to start a company.

I want to learn how to start a successful company that employs people and works on cool projects.

He said, OK, well, I just sold my last company for $30 million cash.

I''ve started multiple companies, I''ve done this before, so why don''t you meet my co-founder and learn with me and you can handle the technical side and Thought about that for a second and it''s like well, I probably won''t get that opportunity ever again So I sort of jumped in and I said, okay, let''s do that We put my job in San Diego came back up to LA slept on his couch and that''s when we started a company called Flanality Finality was creating voice over IP solutions for companies.

Sammy wasn''t getting paid at first.

He had some savings but was blowing through it pretty quick and living as cheap as possible, sleeping on a couch.

But eventually the company started making money, which meant Sammy started getting paid.

Then I think after we were actually making money, because we had become profitable at some point, and then I had a salary and then that salary grew as we came more profitable and didn''t get more rounds and stuff.

So, at some point, I was really fortunate to be able to still support my mom and also have some nice toys.

Things were really looking good for Sammy at this point.

He was 19 years old, making great money at a company that he helped create.

Sammy was a smart young lad, but eventually he got bored.

What do you get when you have a bored hacker?

Yeah, you guessed it.

Trouble.

That''s when I started playing with my space.

My space was the number one site on the internet, and all my friends had, and I sort of held off for a while, and then one day I said, okay, it''s pretty much all my friends have it, so I should just go on there and make an account, see what this is about.

And I made an account, I was like, oh, this is pretty cool, it''s a social network, you can post pictures, and you can post some people''s, I guess you call them profiles back then, and they didn''t have, you wouldn''t call them walls.

If you could have music that auto played, there''s just terrible.

You could do really awful CSS things to your page, but you could also do cool things.

And I really like that.

I actually really appreciate the fact that you could style the page in any way you want it.

You really could beam it and show a little personality.

I thought that was really cool and not something you get to do every day anymore.

So I made a profile, and at this point, pretty technically confident, or I felt that way.

and I thought, well, maybe I can make my profile cooler than some of my friends.

Just more interesting or unique.

So I started saying, all right, well, I could do all the CSS stuff, but how can I really do something interesting?

And I started looking and I think I had gotten like a digital camera and I found that the limitation on the profile pictures was, you can only have some photos.

And I thought it''d be funny just to have a 13th photo.

Like, it''s just a limitation that they had.

No one would really notice, you''d really have to think about it or know this limitation even to realize but I thought that would be sublimating.

funny.

Sammy figured out that the limitation on the number of photos that my space users were allowed to post was set by client side validation.

He realized he could bypass this validation and talk directly to the API server.

And he could submit as many photos as he wanted to my space.

And it worked.

Unbelievable.

So cool.

But now that he had bypassed one validation check, he wondered what What else could he do when you look at a Myspace users profile?

You can see what birthday they have displayed, what their favorite foods are, their music and movies, but there''s also a place to describe your relationship status.

There was a little drop down box.

You could pick single, married, engaged, or in a relationship, but you were bound to only be able to pick one of these that were in the drop down box.

There was no way to enter your own relationship status.

I wanted mine to say in a hot relationship.

That would be funny.

And again, a subtle change.

You couldn''t really do that.

At least back then with that version of CSS.

But I started playing around and said, well, maybe I can execute JavaScript.

Because JavaScript should be able to modify the DOM, modify the page in any way I want.

And I started playing around and found that they pretty much blocked JavaScript in any possible way.

So then I started saying, okay, well, maybe I can mess with the browser.

So I started looking to exploit the browser''s interpretation of tags and found that yes, there''s actually a way that I could execute JavaScript that technically isn''t compliant with say the W3C stack of how HTML should be interpreted, but browsers happen to be pretty lenient and they want web pages to work even if the developer made in there.

So I found a way to execute JavaScript within a CSS tag and then access some data somewhere else on the page and execute JavaScript note.

And this was really cool.

So this allowed me to now change my interrelationship to interrelationship.

Well, another fun and awesome win for Sammy.

At this point, he''s conducted two hacks against Myspace and is looking to see what else he can do.

He realized that when he changed the relationship status, he could get the browser to execute whatever JavaScript he wanted.

But it''s not just that, he could get whoever visited his profile to execute the JavaScript code that he wrote.

To be able to control the browser of whoever visits his page, this was a seriously big deal.

And at that point, it''s like, what else could I do that could be fun?

I started playing around.

I was just doing silly things.

I wanted to see, okay, if someone visited my profile and were not already friends, can I make them at me as a friend?

And I could.

And then I found, well, if I can control their browser, couldn''t I just update their own profile?

And I found, yeah, whenever they visit my profile, I could make them update anything on their profile.

And I didn''t want to be malicious.

I just wanted to do something that I thought was funny.

So I made it so that if you visit my profile, you''d not only would you add me as a friend, but then you would add most of all samis my hero to the bottom of your profile.

I thought that would be kind of funny and after a few days maybe a few of my friends would have it on their profiles and I could just be like hey cool you know point that out to them.

So I release this and a few days go by and nothing really happens like virtually none of my friends have hit it because a lot of people aren''t going to my profile.

So I think okay well how do I make this spread a little faster?

And I''m thinking, all right, if I can make you add me as a friend and add me as a hero to your profile, couldn''t I just copy the code to your profile as well?

So that way, if someone visits that profile, they''ll also add me as a friend, add me as a hero, and then the code will copy to their profile.

So within my friend group, it should probably hit them all within a week or so, and that will be pretty funny.

Someone will complain, and it''ll be taken down, and it''ll be good.

I launch it one night, and I go to sleep, and I wake up hoping to get at least a couple of hits, and unfortunately, I wake up to 10,000 new friends.

10,000 new friends?

Sammy was just trying to have some fun.

He didn''t intend to be malicious, But then it dawned on him.

He''s actually created a virus on my space.

Anyone who visited his profile would immediately add him as a friend.

But then the code to add Sammy as a friend was copied to that person''s profile.

So anyone who visited that person''s profile now had the code to add Sammy as a friend and it just kept spreading.

A virus that spreads itself like this is not just a virus.

It''s a worm.

Sammy has just created a MySpace worm, and it''s spreading way beyond what he thought it would become.

Perhaps he could get a few dozen friends, or even a hundred new friends.

But now he''s got 10,000 new friends, and it''s just constantly going up.

At that point, I just freak out.

I have no idea what to do.

I''m seeing my apartment, and I''m kind of baffled.

So I realized, oops, I just wrote a virus.

And what should I do?

And the problem with the virus is you can''t just remove it like I could remove it from my own profile But that doesn''t mean it''s gonna stop spreading because it''s already spread to thousands of profiles Where you get inflited with messages as well like, you know, you''re just really popular at the same time is having friends People were messaging me they''re like, hey, why are you on my profile?

Hey, every time I try to delete you You come back.

That''s because every time they would delete me from their profile It would return them to their own profile which re-excuted the code which reacted me as a friend So they couldn''t actually delete the virus either themselves, so they really needed my space to do that.

So at that point, I''m like, okay, it''s time for damage control as much as I can do.

So I email my space anonymously.

Hi, I''m a random user of my space.

I have no idea what''s going on.

There''s some weird stuff on my profile.

It looks like a bunch of obfuscated code, and I''m not really sure what it does.

But I think it does detailed explanation of exactly what was going on.

And I think you can fix it by, here''s a detailed explanation of exactly how to fix this problem.

I just prayed that they got it.

Well, I just continued my day.

I mean, at that point, I really couldn''t thank you, so I drove to the office.

In the whole time he''s at work, he''s looking at his Myspace profile and just watching the number of friends he has, rising higher and higher and higher.

150,000, 100,000.

I could not think about anything, I was just refreshing, went home, 500,000, 600,000.

And 600,000 knew my space friends.

Oh, this is going way out of control.

This has to be stopped.

Sammy tried to stop the worm by removing the code on his profile.

I removed the code from my own profile, but that doesn''t do anything, right?

It only removes it so that anyone who is my profile doesn''t get it, but it''s already spreading from anyone else, right?

Once someone else has it, it would just continue to spread.

So there''s no other way to really control it.

Really, my space would have to remember themselves.

Sammy goes off to work, does his shift, comes back home.

600,000, 700,000 it hits a million I just take a screenshot because now I''m just like that''s with a lot of people I had no idea that many people were even on my space.

I just had no idea how big it was I was hoping it would hit a hundred max Over the course of a week or a month or something once it was 10,000 I knew I had done something wrong.

That was I was like, oh, I did not think this through I was just freaked out the entire time.

I was super super concerned because I mean if it hit 10,000 overnight then at that point it was obvious oh yeah it''s just gonna grow ridiculously out of proportion and now I''m refreshing purely because I''m curious how fast it''s spreading so I''m refresh I refresh I refresh and at this point it''s spreading at about 3,000 people per second and as I''m sort of doing this little test of how fast it''s moving I refresh once again and finally my profile has been taken down so I''m pretty happy about this so then I was wondering okay the virus was probably up for about 20 hours.

And I''m thinking, all right, well, does it still say same as my hero and other people''s profiles?

Like, how did they take this down?

So I go to someone else''s profile.

And then I see that that profile is also down like, oh, no.

So I go to myspace.com, just to the website.

And it says, the whole site is down, the whole team is here working on it.

I felt absolutely awful.

I know what it''s like to have servers that are down and I would never want to do that to somebody.

And I''m thinking, okay, the number one site on the internet is down.

And I also recall that MySpace had just been purchased by Fox for half a billion dollars.

And I didn''t really want Fox to come after me.

So I was like, oh no, what do I do?

So I thought about it.

And MySpace is in LA.

So maybe I should just drive over there with some coffee and donuts and be like, hey guys, I''m Sammy.

I''m so sorry.

Can I help do anything?

Can I write some SQL queries?

What can I do?

But I thought that would be a bad idea.

In case they were just really upset, which I would totally understand is where I''d go to jail.

I had no idea what the ramifications of something like this was.

I really had no idea.

Did you tell anyone then?

What did your friends think of this at this point?

Because I mean, the people you work with and stuff, did they know that day?

Like, hey, it''s going crazy.

Your friends, did they know?

And you''re like, hey, and call one of them and say, I think I just took my space down.

I messaged like one or two friends about it.

I should remember explicitly one friend, I messaged just before doing it.

And he''s like, hey, don''t do that.

He was much smarter than I was.

And I think during the thing, I don''t think I''d talk to anyone about it.

My girlfriend, Gred told her, and she thought the whole thing was funny.

And really back then, it was just a social network, it was a small social network, really nothing compared to the networks we have today like Facebook and Twitter.

Granted, it was the largest of the time, but it was 2005, like smartphones had not come out.

There''s a much smaller people in the internet I just didn''t seem as serious.

At this point, my space is down, like the whole website.

Sammy is worried and scared.

The team at my space is probably totally freaking out.

This was the largest social networking site in the world at the time, and it''s down because Sammy decided to have a laugh?

This is not good.

Sammy''s anxiety is growing every minute that the site is down.

He can''t focus on real life right now.

Forget about work, forget about going out with friends.

was what the heck happened to my space?

Was it his worm that took down my space?

How much trouble would he be in if it was?

Hours went by and the site was still down and he was getting more and more anxious as he kept refreshing the page, weeding for it to come back up.

And then hours after the site went down, my space came back online.

Actually, I feel very good that the site is up a few hours later and this way I don''t really know what to do.

like sit around and we''ll start working on other things.

I''m kind of just waiting for the police to come knock on my door.

And a day goes by and a week goes by and I start getting emails from random people on the internet, blog writers and magazines that are like, hey, you know, we heard about the sperm you wrote.

I''m like, I don''t know what you''re talking about.

And they said, is your name Sammy?

I was like, yeah, my name''s Sammy, but you know, I''m not sure what you''re talking about.

And then they sent me a picture and they''re like, is this you?

And it''s my profile picture.

So It was, of course, it''s me and, like, okay, fine.

That was me.

And they started asking, you know, what was this spell?

Like, what was your intention?

This is just a prank on terribly wrong.

They asked, is my state content to you?

And I said, no.

Have the police contacted you?

I say, no.

And a week goes by, two weeks, three months.

Finally, after three months, I''m like, okay.

I''m super fortunate.

No one for my states or police or anything you ever have contacted me.

So, I''m really, really lucky.

I did something pretty dumb.

I''m never doing that again.

And sort of got away, it''s got free.

What a lesson learned, huh?

To accidentally take down the largest social network in the world and not hear from my space or the police, lucky guy.

Because you know what?

Sammy''s fingerprints are all over this worm.

I mean, the worm follows Sammy.

And then the worm actually says, above all, Sammy is my hero.

So it would be really easy for my space to track this back to Sammy, but nothing.

So Sammy just goes back to his regular life, back to his job at finality, which is starting to pay him even more now.

In fact, he was making enough to buy his dream car.

I got a Porsche boxer at the age of 19.

Anyway, he got a brand new car and one day he''s leaving his apartment and he goes down the elevator to the parking garage.

I''m walking down to it, but it''s a brand new car and I see two guys like this standing next to it sitting on it and I''m like oh no I''m getting card jacked and two more guys walk up behind me and then they say Sammy and I was like oh no I realized like card jackers they don''t know your name and they say Sammy we have a search warrant for you this was a surprise six months ago is when he launched a MySpace worm and now they''re coming for him these were representatives from the Secret Services Electronics Crimes Task Force, the LA District Attorney''s Office and the California Highway Patrol.

The highway patrol was there because they had suspicion that Sammy''s fancy new car might have been stolen.

The agents took Sammy into custody and head back up to his apartment.

We all walk up and as we go into my place, there''s a dozen agents already there going through everything.

And what they''re doing is they''re taking everything.

So anything that has data, CD, DVD, my laptop, my computer, my Xbox, and even my iPod was probably worse.

They took my iPod.

All my music was gone.

I loved music, so that was actually somewhat challenging.

Because all my MP3s and any legitimate or illegitimate music I had was gone.

And I was kind of terrified, but also, as someone go with the flow, you know, things happen in life, and you deal with them.

And I''m just waiting for sort of all this to be over, and now I''m reading Search One, because I really want to find out, Like, is this about my space?

Is this about something else?

Is this about some computers I hacked into?

I have no idea.

And I''m reading through, reading through, and then finally I see the words myspace.com.

Okay, good.

So it''s about that.

At least that one was a prank.

Then I''m reading, reading, reading, and then I see another address that they''re allowed to search.

And it''s my office.

So I asked them, are you guys gonna search my office?

They''re like, we''re already there.

One of the ages asked me, what''s that on your counter?

So in my living room, there was a table and it had some equipment on it, some smart card reader writer stuff and some smart cards stuff.

And it''s like, what are you doing with that?

And at this point, I think, okay, the Secret Service agent just asked me what these smart cards are.

And in my head, I''m like, should I tell them or should I lie about what this is?

And my friend was staying at my apartment for work at my company.

And I was showing him that I had to hack the laundry machines in our apartment building so that I could get free laundry.

And I was basically cloning smart cards or like replaying the information from a smart card to make it appear that it had more money than it did and I decided I should not lie to these people so I just told them that and fortunately they only just laughed and that''s nothing else came of that afterwards they collected everything and then they walked out and I''m like hey guys like are you taking me with you and they said no no you''re not under arrest at least for now and I said oh okay and they walked away and all of a sudden I just had no computers.

I went to the office.

Unfortunately, somehow the CEO was able to convince them that I was like an intern and that I had no access to anything, because when they came in, they said, hey, what to say?

I mean, can''t we have access to it?

The CEO was like, well, everything.

And they''re like, all right, guys, take everything.

This is a cloud-based company.

So when you take everything back then, we ran all the servers.

So they were about to take all of our servers, which would just bankrupt us instantly.

Fortunately, he convinced them something else that I was an intern or something weird, and they only took my stuff, just my computer, my phone.

And at that point, I got an attorney, and we ended up basically fighting with the LADA for about six months.

The Los Angeles DA charged Sammy with modifying data on a remote machine.

In settlement talks, prosecutors proposed that Sammy served some time in prison and not be able to use his computer for the rest of his life.

Keep in mind that Sammy was supporting his mother, and as a high school dropout, his only skill set in his livelihood We''re entirely dependent on using a computer.

Semi was so bright and gifted and passionate about computers and technology on the internet and hacking.

You can imagine how scary it was for him to face the prospect of having to live the rest of his life without ever being able to use a computer again.

Probably the hardest part, really the hardest part of anything I think, at least for me, is not knowing what an outcome will be.

I think it''s much easier to deal with, maybe even the most challenging outcome.

If I know that''s going to happen, you just tell me, okay, I''m going to go to the prison for the rest of my life, then I can at least mentally try to prepare for that.

But not knowing was just really difficult to deal with.

But ultimately, I took a plea agreement with them.

And the plea agreement was no prison time, so that was nice.

However, I would not be able to touch a computer for the rest of my life.

That was still in there.

And probation indefinitely, I would have to pay some restitution, I''d have to do a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

In fact, it also explicitly stated I could not access MySpace.com, so in case I somehow was able to access it without the internet of our computer.

So that was it.

Sammy had lost everything.

I mean, forget about the Porsche at this point, because on top of all this, they gave him a $20,000 fine.

So between having to pay all the lawyers and the fine and still having to support his mom, yeah, he was almost completely wiped out, almost back to zero, living as cheap as possible.

But still, forget all that.

I don''t think Sammy carried about the money at this point.

He was back to trying to figure out what he should do with his entire life.

No internet for life?

Everything he''s been working towards, all his skills and knowledge are useless now.

Sammy had 720 hours of community service he had to complete.

So every Saturday morning, he''d get up at 5 a.m. and go clean trash on the side of the highway for years.

Even if he did six hours every Saturday, that''s still just 300 hours a year, so everything about Sammy''s life was changed.

And he had to find new things to do that didn''t involve a computer to keep himself busy.

But I was really fortunate.

I mean, I met new people, I spent all that time just sort of doing other things that I had never really spent time doing.

I went outside, I saw the sun was like, ah, it''s so bright, but I got used to it.

that I made friends, I turned 21, so I get started going out meeting people, started learning to socialize a lot more.

So it''s really, really beneficial to me and something I wouldn''t really change today learned so much from that experience.

And I think it was good for someone so introverted and so stuck to a computer to be able to go out and experience other things.

So Sammy spent years of his life offline, doing his community service and trying to socialize with his friends.

But the story doesn''t end here.

After the break, Sammy gets to use computers again.

After two years of probation, Sammy has served all 720 hours of his community service.

He had great behavior.

The probation officer didn''t find anything wrong that Sammy did.

And since he had such great behavior, they went back to court to see if he could get the probation lifted.

And after a few years, I went back to court, and today, you know, my probation officer loves me.

It says I''m our favorite client, and they said, okay, you are a lot of touch computers again.

That was a very interesting experience.

I felt really weird touching the computer afterwards.

We kind of just get used to the rules that you''re abiding by, and it''s definitely an awkward feeling jumping back in.

What happens on that day that you got it back?

I definitely remember that day because I drove to the LA Courthouse and after I left the courthouse, I drove to the office store and found whatever the latest, you know, top of the line.

I don''t even think it was a MacBook.

It might have been a power book at that time.

I bought the top of the line power book and I went to a coffee shop.

I pulled it open and I connected to the Wi-Fi and I visited a couple of websites, so I think I visited the flash drive just to see what''s going on.

And I just felt really weird and I just shut the laptop and I went to go hang out with friends.

This started the next chapter in Sammy''s life.

Now that he was free to use the computer again, he eventually got back into it, way into it.

Even though he hadn''t been allowed to use a computer for the last two years, he had spent that time thinking of all sorts of things he can do with them.

During that time that I had no internet, I had no computers.

I started thinking about new exploits, new ways to really manipulate more systems and like exploit routers and exploit firewalls and just had some concepts literally just in my head and I couldn''t confirm whether they were accurate or not, whether they would work after I came back online.

And I started thinking, well, this stuff is fun.

Like maybe I can do this stuff, but not impact websites, not impact people negatively.

So how can I investigate the technology around us, look for the vulnerabilities around us and then share that information publicly in an entirely legal way so people actually understand the problems and can use solutions.

So just six months after Sammy had completed his probation for hacking my space, as 2008, Sammy was around 21 years old and starts looking into hacking credit cards, specifically the NFC and RFID chips on them.

Yeah, some other researchers and myself, we''re looking at these NFC credit cards which are becoming a lot more ubiquitous today but back then it was fun kind of funny they actually came out with these credit cards with NFC and pretty quickly they were encrypted somewhere encrypted however you could actually just buy a chip with the decryption key so you would just buy a chip from a company and you could then decrypt anyone''s credit card access their credit card info and then literally steal stuff with it and that was not my intention But I want to show that this stuff is not secure, so I just created a proof of concept that opened up this to some additional credit cards And there were some other tools that did similar things for other types of credit cards And I know mine was like a visa chase card that no one hadn''t done this for yet How close to someone do you have to be to get their credit card details?

Like does it work from far away?

I haven''t really experimented with how far you can do it So I''m not sure you do need to be close to them It''s very easy to be within proximity of many many people you just go to a crowded place and now you can see all many, many credit cards and then you can go home and buy a ton of stuff online or you can sell those credit cards online and really just steal money.

Even just bumping up against someone in the line, if they have an NFC or RFID vulnerable credit card in their pocket, that would be good enough to steal their credit card, right?

That''s correct.

That''s such a trip.

You know what''s funny is after releasing that and demonstrating that NFC then disappeared from our credit cards and it only recently re-emerged in the past few years and now with much stronger cryptography and additional safeguards from these sorts of tax.

However, there are other attacks.

I mean, it will always be cat and mouse right now.

Nothing is ever perfectly secure and to be fair, it''s much easier to be the attacker.

Well, Sammy studied how to hack the chips within credit cards.

He never did anything malicious with this.

He never actually stole anyone''s credit cards that he didn''t have permission to steal.

Instead, he started blogging about this and teaching others about the safety involved with these products in an attempt to make them more secure.

And from then on, Sammy would continue to research the security of so many more things, but always in an ethical and safe way.

He would do this on his own equipment and disclose what he found to vendors.

For instance, Sammy recently released a proof of concept to show how you can steal passwords and encryption keys by just listening.

This sort of stuff has been done for years by other people, by researchers, and I''m just trying to see can I do this on a two dollar chip or an Arduino that many people know how to use and many makers can just buy off the shelf and then they perform these types of attacks.

There''s a tax out there where researchers have demonstrated just taking a phone, a regular phone, putting it near a computer, and when a computer is doing some sort of cryptographic operation and maybe it''s encrypting an email, maybe it''s trying to send some Bitcoin, maybe it''s doing a financial transaction, maybe it''s logging into a bank.

When any of these things are being done and the processor is like processing those instructions in a certain order, Well, the processor requires power and different instructions require different amounts of power.

So, addition will be less power than a multiplication, which is really just a bunch of additions.

And you can then measure that power, but if you have a phone, you can use the microphone.

So, let''s say I''ve put a phone next to someone''s laptop and they''re encrypting an email with like the secret key.

Well, when that CPU is pulling power from all these capacitors, those capacitors are going through this thing called electro-strictive effect and they''re physically moving inside your computer and they''re moving at a speed, a rate against the circuit board inside that produces ultrasound.

You and I can''t hear ultrasound, but the phones that we have, the mobile devices we have, those microphones actually can listen all the way into the ultrasound range.

And if you have, say, an Android device with a microphone enabled and it listens to that ultrasound, you can then look at that sound, that amplitude or the volume of the sound, And then correlated and say, well, the higher the sound, the more power those capacitors are using and feeding to the CPU.

And if I know it''s this much power for this long, well, I can do timing and power analysis and say, well, that means you''re doing an addition here or you''re probably doing a jump or a branch here or a comparison here.

And this looks like you''re doing an AES encryption at 128 bit key.

And, you know, if you''re encrypting with a zero bit or so one bit, that''s going to take different instructions with different amount of power.

and then I can fully recover that key.

It''s pretty impressive.

And these are the types of attacks that are really explaining physical phenomena, right?

Things that a software developer might implement something perfectly, but there''s still these other attacks.

Sammy continued finding new areas to do security research in.

And at some point, he got interested in cookies.

Cookies are what web browsers use to remember who you are.

So when you return to a website, they can log you in or show you content that''s just for you.

So cookies are a tracking mechanism, and browser store these cookies on the user''s computer.

In a very specific location, but as Sammy looked into it, he was noticing some websites figured out a way to track users without storing the cookie in that traditional location.

For instance, some sites ran Flash to display fancy graphics.

Well, when you get to that website, the Flash video is downloaded and stored on your computer, and the next time you go to that website, your browser checks to see if you already have that video or if you need to download it.

But people were really concerned because some researchers found that some companies were using flash to store cookies on people''s computers.

And the benefit of this was that if a user deletes their normal cookies, their normal web browser or cookies, which is what advertisers used to track you, well, then the flash cookie was essentially acting as a backup, right?

And really serotoniously, because they obviously did that intentionally because they knew users might delete their omics.

And I was thinking, well, the browser was a pretty powerful piece of software until a lot of things.

I wonder what other mechanisms where I could actually store information locally.

And again, this is sort of a proof of concept to demonstrate what are all the ways that we can store information on a person''s computer whether they know it or not.

So I created this open source JavaScript library called EverCookie and it used normal cookies.

So it essentially generated random ID to track somebody.

And then you store it in their normal cookies, you store it in flash cookies.

But then I tried to find every possible other mechanism that you could use locally.

So there were silver lights.

So you silver light storage and then Java and HTML5 came out.

So then there was local storage and session storage, global storage, SQL light, local cache, your web history.

My friend Matt came up with a really cool idea of just storing the data in an image that would get cached.

And then you could actually read out the pixels of an image and then converted it back to an ID, all sorts of stuff.

And that was people like Matt and other people also started contributing to this project as it''s an entirely open source project on GitHub that that anyone can actually contribute to.

This ever cookie project that Sammy made really demonstrated how easy it is for websites to track their users even if they delete their cookies.

And this was a really effective technique.

So effective that when Snowden released a bunch of classified documents about what the NSA is doing, in there it even said that the NSA sometimes uses ever cookie to track its users through tour.

A couple people pointed out to me over the years that different governments have been using ever cookie to try to track people.

And it definitely feels good that a lot of governments are using my software, granted they''re doing it for a reason that I''m not into.

But I actually think the net gain of the entire project is extremely positive because whatever cookie really provided and still provides today is an asset test.

So now browsers essentially can use ever cookie to see, okay, does my private mode, does my incognito mode, does that provide the necessary protection to make get challenging to track this user, at least using local storage mechanisms.

And before ever cookie, there was nothing like that.

So no one knew about many of these techniques, and it''s very trivial for any company or government to then generate their own techniques.

But by consolidating it into a very simple to use the library, and always trying to keep it up to date, you know, people today are still updating ever cookie with new techniques.

Modern browsers that want to provide consumers and users and businesses privacy, it gives in that capability, because they know, okay, I''ve tested it at least against Evercooki, which is sort of state of the art and local storage mechanisms, and Evercooki can''t track it, so at least it makes it very difficult.

So governments who are using it, they''re really only able to track all browser users who don''t upgrade their browsers to operating systems.

Where people who actually do care about their privacy, those people typically know to use modern up-to-date software.

So I think the overall net gain is extremely beneficial.

Let''s talk about Skyjack then, because I think this is a really cool project.

What is Skyjack?

Skyjack started when I started hearing that Amazon was potentially going to use drones to deliver packages.

And I thought that was really cool, I mean, I think it''s really awesome that we have drones.

I think drones are super interesting, they''re low cost, and they''ll probably enable a lot of really useful things for humans.

However, I was somewhat concerned that that was the idea.

was like delivering just packages because I don''t really know if there''s any security on drones.

So I wasn''t sure I really didn''t know anything about drones so I went out and I bought the most ubiquitous consumer drone and then soon after I also bought industrial drones, type of drones that police use.

And immediately I started looking to see what are the protection mechanisms at least in the consumer drone and immediately I found absolutely zero.

Literally none.

You know one drone was using essentially Wi-Fi to be controlled and you could hijack that connection.

You could only have one person controlling the drone at a time, so if I would just essentially kick that person off and then I would take over and then I would modify the drone software so that the person could never log back in and then I would have full control and I found that I could do that and then I started looking at more industrial drones and found that they did have encryption.

However, that encryption was not good at all.

Basically, if you sat on a radio frequency channel, essentially it''s doing frequency hopping, So the transmitter is jumping around to different frequencies for various reasons, partially security, partially to prevent jamming or if there''s a lot of interference that interference will disappear after it hops to the next frequency.

But that was also based off the encryption key.

I found a packet sit on a single frequency and I see two packets come in from that drone, essentially it would have hopped hundreds of times.

And then I jump onto another frequency and I see it hopped on that frequency two times.

all of that would typically take a couple seconds tops.

I would then be able to reverse the key within a second.

I would be able to understand what the encryption key is and then I would be able to hop along and take over that drone as well.

So at that point I put all of this into an open source project called Skyjack.

I put on GitHub and I took a Raspberry Pi Linux computer.

I put my software on it.

I added some Wi-Fi transceivers and some sub-gigaheads transceivers for the industrial drones and you would then attach this Raspberry Pi to your own drone, and you''d fly your own drone around, and while you''re flying your drone around, Skyjack ever saw another drone on any of these wireless frequencies or within wireless range, it would then hijack and take over that drone, and you would now be in control of both drones.

In fact, any wireless drones found in the vicinity, you would take over all of them, and you''d be controlling a swarm of zombie drones entirely under your control from one transmitter.

And that was sort of the proof of concept there, and it was a really fun project, especially fun to be testing it.

Of course, I was testing only on my own drones that I owned, but it of course affected pretty much all models of old major drones at time.

No, I''ve flown a drone.

And one of those scariest feelings I''ve ever had is when you lose control of the thing and it just starts doing its own thing for whatever reason, right?

I mean, that''s a little bit evil what you''re doing here.

I''m not taking over anyone''s else''s drone.

I''ve only taken over my own.

Okay.

But giving the world the ability to do it, I don''t know.

I would disagree with that statement because the world has always had that capability of doing it, right?

How do you know people other people aren''t doing it already?

I would actually suspect that there are plenty of organizations who are doing it.

They''re just not going to tell you about it, right?

They''re not going to put it on the internet.

They''re not going to put it on GitHub and let you know that they''re taking over people''s drones or that they''ve developed the software and hardware necessary to do it.

They''re just going to create that and they''re going to stockpile it so that they can use it against people or companies or governments at their will.

That''s what we found when the NSA say leaks came out, we found out that they were stockpiling all of these vulnerabilities, including major, major vulnerabilities that affected many even the NSA that wants to protect America, knows that everyone''s running, say Windows computer, many people are running Windows computers, and they stockpiled Windows vulnerability zero days that nobody knew about.

It was only when one of these databases from the NSA was bleak that criminals were then able to use those exploits and actually attack many, many millions of computers around the internet, Americans and non-Americans, I don''t think it matters where you''re from.

So what I''m doing by releasing this stuff is demonstrating that, yes, this is the issue and you can patch it.

If I don''t release it, then the issue will continue to exist.

You might ask, well, why don''t I just directly communicate with the companies?

Often I do.

And I found over time that when you communicate directly with companies, they typically don''t resolve these sorts of things.

Unless you''re talking maybe existing, you know, specific software vulnerabilities in their architecture.

But if you''re saying, hey, you''re not using encryption or using like really wrong or it''s really the underlying protocol that is the issue.

I found that that''s when people don''t actually resolve anything.

And that''s when I started releasing stuff publicly and finding, oh, if you release a cool proof of concept that demonstrates the real problem, the underlying core problem, even if it''s not necessarily an issue with maybe the manufacturer, but rather a problem with the underlying protocol and just assumptions that were made, there is enough public pressure that causes that company to then resolve that issue due to the public pressure, not due to the vulnerability itself.

Because that''s often what companies are trying to do and no fault to them.

They''re trying to do what their customers want, right?

They''re trying to do what might move the needle for them.

And I found that this is an effective and appropriate way I believe to move the needle in a direction that I believe will help many people overall rather than just manufacture a company or a specific organization.

Has any company gotten upset with you and tried to come after you for some reason of disclosing vulnerabilities in their system publicly?

I''ve gotten seasoned assists many times, and it''s extremely fortunate that the EFF electronic frontier foundation, they have actually been very helpful to me, and they''re a nonprofit of attorneys who are really just looking for consumers and digital rights.

So your ability to have free speech online, your ability to inspect the software and hardware you use, the ability to own the things that you purchase.

I mean, there are companies who are trying to take this away from us.

But the EFF, I mean, really fortunate where they''ve defended me in some of these regards.

And so I''ve never had to succumb to and actually agree to assist to this day.

For the last decade, Sammy has continued to take on very interesting projects, hacking into stuff and exposing vulnerabilities.

Like another thing he found was that smartphones were tracking their users without their knowledge, which was a revelation that led to a class action lawsuit.

This all started because I was looking at I think a beta version of Firefox at the time.

And I was looking at the release notes and it talked about geolocation and I said cool that''s interesting like I''ve always been interested in location like being able to locate where someone is whether it''s on their cell phone or their computer or laptop or whatever.

And you know there''s always been these geo IP databases that sort of give you geography but really they''re or maybe accurate to the city, but often not.

And even city accuracy is not that great.

So I saw this thing about HTML5 geolocation and a Firefox data, and I started investigating, I wrote some code according to API of how it worked.

I ran it and all of a sudden, my browsers showed me exactly where I was.

Like literally, it showed me the physical address of my home.

And I was like, that''s absolutely crazy.

I''m on a laptop and my laptop does not have GPS.

I know that for a fact.

So how does it know where I am?

And I started sniffing the packets to see where it was going.

I mean, granted, you could just look at the source code.

It''s Firefox, so it''s open source.

And after sniffing, and I think maybe intercepting the TLS, I saw that it''s taking all of the wireless MAC address, all of the unique MAC addresses, all the routers around you, NAPs, and sending that to Google.

So even if your wireless routers are encrypted, and even if you don''t have one, and there are other people who have them, even if they''re encrypted, the MAC address is a unique identifier that isn''t unencrypted.

and your computer sends all of those to Google.

And Google returns the exact location that you''re located.

And you''re also sending only the wireless routers but the signal strength of each of them.

So then they can actually perform what''s called trilaterations, like triangulation, but essentially they use that signal strength and then really accurate this term where you are.

And I''m like, this is absolutely crazy.

How are they figuring all this out?

And I found that you''re basically sending all of these unique Mac addresses of all these routers around you and Google would send back.

your exact location.

So then I''m wondering, well, how does Google know where all these routers are?

And I thought about it some and I thought about some more and then I was, oh, there''s these Google Street View cars and these Google Street View cars are driving around and they have cameras on them and that''s where you get Street View from, right?

That really helpful feature of Google Maps where you can see like a Street View.

And I realized that they must have computers and like Wi-Fi systems on there that are also monitoring for these Wi-Fi Mac addresses and then correlating it with the GPS of the Street View Car and then uploading it all to Google and that''s how they''re getting this information.

It''s like that''s really clever.

And I started doing talks about this because I then found a way that I could essentially abuse that API and use it for myself whenever someone visit my website and I could see exactly where they were and I could even show them.

You''d come to my website, without your authorization, I could then send your Mac address and find where you are.

And I was talking about this in broader Slava and Slovakia and afterward someone said, say I mean, it''s interesting, but fortunately, you know, this does not apply to us because Google Street View cars are not allowed here.

Interesting.

So I''ll just give it a shot and try to running it, just confirm.

And oddly enough, it still worked.

It actually worked very accurately.

And it''s like, wait a second.

I don''t think Google''s lying.

I don''t believe that they are doing something illegal.

I don''t think they have Street View cars when they say they''re not doing that.

And you would notice, I mean, those cars stick out with with these massive sensors on top of them.

So what else might Google have access to, especially in somewhere random like Bratislava?

And I thought a little bit more and then realized, oh wait, Android phones.

There are Android phones everywhere.

And I wonder if these Android phones are actually we''re driving machines.

And after the reverse engineering, some binary blobs on Android devices, this was not actually in the source code that I could find.

I found these binaries that were essentially grabbing all Wi-Fi Mac addresses, is sending the signal strength of all these wireless routers up to Google along with GPS coordinates.

So essentially every Android phone in existence is a war driving machine for Google.

That''s grabbing all this information, grabbing all this location data.

So even if you don''t use an Android phone, other Android phones near you are then taking your routers information and sending it up with the location.

Sammy also figured out that iPhones were doing the same thing, but sending the data to Apple instead of Google.

And what''s worse is that in some cases, this was happening even after users turned off the location services or GPS.

Well, this was encrypted, so it took a little time to really understand what was going on in reverse engineering stuff.

And to really just demonstrate this as a fun proof of concept, I created a tool, really just a simple mobile app that behaved just like Google Maps.

And I found that Google was actually doing something really clever with their information, not only were they collecting where everyone was at all times via Android devices, but that''s also how they collect traffic.

So that''s how you know whether a street is green, yellow, or red, and whether there''s traffic or not in Google Maps is because all of the phones are constantly delivering their GPS location.

And if you time that, if you say, all right, I''m here now and in 10 seconds I''m here, well, you can calculate the distance they traveled over that time and know how fast they''re moving.

So that''s how they get Google Maps traffic.

So Sam, he thought about this for a minute and realized if the Android phones are the ones that are delivering data to Google and giving the traffic updates for the Google Maps, could he somehow exploit that?

Could he somehow trick Google servers into thinking there''s a traffic jam when there''s really not?

I created a app that was just like Google Maps and you''d start from point A and say, I''m at this location and I want to drive to wherever to West Hollywood.

And it would give you turn-by-turn directions.

But on those turn-by-turn directions of my route, it would sound only tangibly pretend to be thousands and thousands of other Android devices.

And all those devices, all those fake devices, would send up information to Google saying, hey, I''m one of these Android devices, and I''m moving zero miles per hour.

So all of a sudden, my route, the route that my app gave me, would turn red and black for everyone else, and they would get diverted to different routes on Google Maps.

And hopefully, my route would be a little bit faster as there would be less cars on the road.

And that was sort of my proof and concept to demonstrating this sort of this issue.

And I''ve some of this could even continue even when you turned off these features, like, location.

I love this hack.

To make it so wherever you drive, Google traffic is diverting drivers to go away from you because it''s congested wherever you are.

Even though it''s not congested where you are, you''re just sending fake data to Google.

It''s just brilliant.

Yeah, you know, it''s the proof of concept just to poke fun at the information and kind of just demonstrate like what this information is capable of doing.

While this is cool, the underlying issue here is that users were unknowingly sending their exact location to Google.

And I don''t know about you, but I don''t personally like that Google knows exactly where my phone is at all times.

I just think it''s a violation of privacy of some sort.

And you know what?

I''m not the only one who thinks that.

Yeah, so ultimately, you know, the biggest issue was that people weren''t accepting that A, they were sending all this data up.

So ultimately, Google and Apple had to appear on Capitol Hill because they previously said, no, we''re not tracking you.

And, you know, this research demonstrated that, yes, in fact, they were tracking exactly where you are virtually at all times.

And in some cases, it begins to your consent when you turned off location services on Apple.

Again, those devices were still sending information that allowed full location of where you were because it was sending Mac addresses, which they already knew where those were.

So it''s simply one step correlation in a database they already have.

So that''s not really fair to say that they''re not grabbing that information.

And ultimately, you know, they did resolve these things.

You know, it''s funny that the same thing is still happening, right?

All these phones are still doing the same things.

The only difference is now you click OK when they say they do it.

But the benefit here is that for people who don''t want this sort of technology to run, they can say no on their phone.

The scary thing, though, is that even if you don''t even have one of these phones, it''s all the phones around that are still collecting that information of your router, of the devices on your network, even though it''s somebody else''s device.

I saw a video the other day about a guy who put like a hundred Android cell phones all in a wagon and slowly walked down the road, and this triggered the Google location API thing to make it show that the road was really congested and made it turn red as well.

So it looks like this API is still under attack just by researchers and people doing weird stunts and stuff So yeah, Sammy has a pretty cool YouTube channel.

You should check that out And he''s also given a lot of talks at various conferences like she''s all over the world How many talks have you given at this point Sammy?

I don''t know maybe 50 or so Where are you working now and after all days?

I mean this is just such a whirlwind life you''ve had so far I''ve started a company called Open Path with some friends, and we''ve been growing quite a bit.

I''ve done some research in RFID and cloning badges, and being able to demonstrate how to break into buildings.

Many years ago, we found that technology has not changed in the 10 years since I''ve looked.

You know, wrote software that was able to clone badges and break into various levels of security for physical access for buildings.

And we were sitting around and thinking, well, you know, why is this still a problem?

And it''s still inconvenient.

Like, why do I have to carry around this thick card in my wallet?

like I''m trying to get rid of my wallet.

And we ended up building this business called Open Path where you could essentially have physical access control for businesses and buildings where, hey, you don''t need a card.

You could use a card if you wanted, but you could just use your phone.

Your phone actually has really strong encryption.

We have things like TLS, we have AES, we have open encryption standards that people have been trying to break for many, many years and haven''t that are entirely open and can be inspected by anyone.

So we''re using those technologies to essentially unlock doors and you don''t even need to pull your phone out.

You literally just get within Bluetooth range of one of these devices, then you can walk right in as long as you have authorization.

So we''re trying to really make a really modern and cloud-based and secure way of getting into buildings that is just really convenient because I''m just trying to get rid of the things in my wallet and this kind of technology is just really interesting.

Yes, that technology is interesting, but so much technology is interesting.

And we live in a time where technology is in abundance all around us.

And if you think about technology as much as Sammy does, it''s like a playground for him.

To be able to tinker with it all and take it apart and put it back together in ways it was never intended, Sammy''s hacker mindset is still going strong today and it will probably be strong for decades more to come, provided he doesn''t accidentally launch another warm and take down the largest social networking website once again.

A big thank you to Sammy Camcart for coming on and telling us all this.

Hey, it''s Jack, host of the show.

When I was a kid, I got an ant farm from my birthday.

It''s like two panes of glass with some sand in between and you can watch the ants dig tunnels and go about their day.

It was really cool, but when you get the ant farm, it doesn''t contain any ants.

You have to order the ants and they''re mailed to you.

And the first thing I thought about when I was a kid and I heard about this was, wait a minute, I can mail ants to anyone I want.

And I think that is basically the hacker mindset to completely ignore some things intended use and find new ways to employ it.

Today we''re going to talk with a hacker who sees the world this way and will hear all the joy and trouble it''s brought him over the years.

Okay, today we''re gonna have a chat with someone so infamous, he has his own worm named after him, the Sammy worm.

That''s right.

Today we''re talking with Sammy Camcar.

Sammy is a hacker in almost every way.

He does things he''s not supposed to do.

He''s the kind of guy that thinks buttons are toys and you push them for fun just to see what they do, which often ends up breaking something.

I was never malicious person at all.

So all this hacking, all of this exploitation, it''s really about a puzzle.

To me, this was all a puzzle, a really fun puzzle.

There''s a lot of reasons to call Sammy infamous.

But to tell his story, we need to go back to his childhood.

When I was nine years old, my mom bought me my first computer.

So I spent everything she had, so I''d have something to do during the summer.

She knew I lived computers.

I''d always go to the library with her or to her university and go and just spend all day at the library on the computers that they had.

And immediately I went online and I started searching for the ex files, which is obviously the best TV show of the time.

I found some message boards and that quickly became really frustrating to after a refresh and a wait for people to update that message board.

So then I found something called IRC, Internet Relay Chat.

And I jumped on, I went into a channel and said, hey, he wants a chat about the ex files.

and immediately someone told me, get out.

And I''m thinking, that''s weird.

This is like a random person I don''t know on the internet and they''re telling me to do something?

No. So I told the guy, no.

And then he said, you have 10 seconds to get out of this chapter.

And I said, no.

And 10 seconds later, the brand new computer that my mom spent everything on crashes.

I had a blue screen and I freaked out.

I had no idea what to do.

do.

I pulled the power from the back of the computer.

I waited about half an hour for all the bad stuff to get out of the computer.

I think that''s what you''re supposed to do.

And then I plugged it back in.

Unfortunately, it came back up.

Everything was fine.

But really with your adrenaline still rushing through my veins, I was thinking that is the coolest thing ever.

How do I do that?

From that point forward, Sammy was addicted to computers.

This was so fascinating to him.

He wanted to understand how this had been possible.

So he began studying computers and practicing programming.

Since he now had a computer at home, he got into video games too.

Counter-strike was his favorite game.

You know, the first person shooter, he played it a lot.

He was addicted to it.

It was fun.

I mean, it was a ton of fun.

I''ve had a clan and I was playing with a bunch of friends in high school and I remember just one day I was playing and I heard some footsteps.

My computer has two speakers, you know, one on the left side, one on the right side.

So some stereo sound and I hear some footsteps coming from the right speaker and then I hear them panning to the left speaker so that immediately tells me oh there''s someone behind me because I can''t see them in my visual field of view in the game.

So immediately I''m like wait, that means someone is behind me in the game.

This is a live person, someone else on the internet playing Counter Strike with me, but I can''t see them in my radar, which means they''re on the opposing team, so I wondered right then, couldn''t I really use that information, that sound information, on the computer itself?

I''m sure that person killed me pretty quickly, but afterwards I exited Counter Strike, and I started looking into how can I pull that information?

What''s telling the computer to play footsteps on the right speaker, rather than left speaker, because that means there''s positional information there that someone is on the right side versus the left side.

And sure enough, I started learning about packet sniffing and then memory injection and intercepting function calls within the DLLs of CounterStrike itself and intercepting basically everything between the binary, the CounterStrike executable and the DLLs that it used so that I could intercept things like footsteps.

And once I hooked that function, I was then able to get exact coordinates of everyone, because everyone''s footsteps is actually being sent to you.

At least within some range, you will then get that, and that''s just telling your computer where to play the sound.

But that location is exactly where that person''s located.

At that point, I started using OpenGL at the time, and just drawing where the user is on the map in a little heads-up display and a little radar.

And then I started jumping into writing counter-strike cheats software.

That was a lot of fun.

Where were some of the cheats you could do?

Just writing aim bots, so being automatically aiming at people, being able to make any smoke bomb or smoke grenade or flashbang, just make those transparent to me.

So I could go into a room that I knew is full of opposing team members and throw in a flashbang.

And they''re all going to see white for three seconds and I''m going to run in there and see absolutely nothing because I''ve hooked that function and said do nothing.

Just return out.

You know, do a return before you actually do any of the visualization to sort of wipe my screen.

and little things like that became really fun.

I couldn''t actually modify my health that was controlled by this server.

So I couldn''t actually make myself invincible, adding zoom to every weapon.

So weapons that didn''t normally have zoom or might have like a scope on them.

So you lose a lot of the screen because it''s now blacked out.

I would just remove those.

There''s no reason that it''s green to zoom blacked out.

I would remove that.

There''s no reason that zoom should be better in one weapon than not the other.

So I had to zoom to all weapons.

And this is all totally unfair.

and pretty quickly it actually became not fun at all.

Like all of the fun of the game went away entirely because all of a sudden it was practically god mode.

Sammy released the Counter Strike cheats as open source software.

He was beginning to get bored playing the game and then punk buster came out and punk buster is a program that''s designed to scan the memory to see if anyone is cheating in the game and punk buster stopped Sammy from using his cheats.

But now the new game was for Sammy to try to circumvent whatever punk buster was using to detect him.

All of a sudden this game was fun again, because I was no longer playing the game.

I was now playing against these engineers on punk buster.

They were doing their own memory inspection.

They were looking for my process.

They were doing all sorts of things to stop my cheats and other people''s cheats as well.

And that became fun.

At that point I was probably 15 years old.

So it''s so attached to this that I stopped going to high school and I started updating my cheats because this was just so fun and it would be cat and mouse.

So I would release a new version that defeated their software and two days later they would release a new version and then I would have to figure out what do they do, how do they figure it out.

And that was like training.

It was sort of very rapid training in how does at the very least software and networking work.

And I think I probably learned a ton just during that short stint when I was writing this cheats software.

at 16, you dropped out of high school, what did you do after that?

I wasn''t good at school.

I didn''t care about most classes, so I did not do well.

It was not a good learner.

No one ever taught me how to learn something.

I think that was something that I learned later in life.

I just wish there were tools that were taught at school for me.

I think I would have been a much better student.

However, if I''m enjoying something, then I will absolutely learn it.

I''ll spend all my time on it.

I''m still not necessarily a fast learner like I''ve always known that people can pick up stuff much faster than me But if there''s something I enjoy then I''m just gonna spend all my time on it and you know, I''m very persistent Sammy was living at home with his mom in Los Angeles at the time She had recently lost her job and now that she was home more often She noticed Sammy wasn''t going to school and told him if he''s not gonna go to school He needs to get a job to help pay the rent so Sammy started applying for any job he thought he could get.

I got an email out of the blue from a company in San Diego and said, hey, we saw your cheat software, your camera strike stuff.

And will you be willing to contract and just write code for us remotely?

And I was blown away.

I was like, wait, someone will pay me to write code.

Like, I thought this was just useful for basically writing cheat software.

Like, I had no idea that you could use it for other things.

I mean, it was obvious that you could sort of program things, but I just know someone would pay me money to do that.

So I was really, really fortunate in getting that email and I started working with them and just remotely writing code for them and they never met me.

I mean, never even talked on the phone.

It was just all over the email.

And they said, hey, do you want to move to San Diego and work full time with us?

And I said absolutely.

So I took my mom''s car and I just drove down and I met them and I think they were kind of weirded out because they didn''t expect a 15 year old to show up.

and they weren''t even sure if that was legal and I was like oh no don''t worry I looked into it it''s totally legal here''s a work permit that I got from my school which is really just a work permit I had forged and printed out and I just started working with this company down in San Diego and that was really cool and that allowed me to support myself and my mom and she continued to live in LA but I got to start my own life down there which is really great.

That is incredible.

And San Diego, as a teenager, Sammy was working as a programmer, but eventually took on the responsibilities of a systems administrator.

He was making pretty good money for his age, then someone in LA tried to recruit him to work at a startup, and this was the deal, quit your job and come work for us.

Initially, we can''t pay you, but you can have some equity in the company and sleep on a founder''s couch while the startup gets off the ground.

And I said, oh, thanks for that offer now.

Thank you.

And he said, well, what do you want to do with your life?

What do you want to do the next few years?

I thought that was a really good question.

I honestly had not thought about it.

This is not something I normally think about.

And I thought about it for a while.

And I was like, well, I want to learn how to start a company.

I want to learn how to start a successful company that employs people and works on cool projects.

He said, OK, well, I just sold my last company for $30 million cash.

I''ve started multiple companies, I''ve done this before, so why don''t you meet my co-founder and learn with me and you can handle the technical side and Thought about that for a second and it''s like well, I probably won''t get that opportunity ever again So I sort of jumped in and I said, okay, let''s do that We put my job in San Diego came back up to LA slept on his couch and that''s when we started a company called Flanality Finality was creating voice over IP solutions for companies.

Sammy wasn''t getting paid at first.

He had some savings but was blowing through it pretty quick and living as cheap as possible, sleeping on a couch.

But eventually the company started making money, which meant Sammy started getting paid.

Then I think after we were actually making money, because we had become profitable at some point, and then I had a salary and then that salary grew as we came more profitable and didn''t get more rounds and stuff.

So, at some point, I was really fortunate to be able to still support my mom and also have some nice toys.

Things were really looking good for Sammy at this point.

He was 19 years old, making great money at a company that he helped create.

Sammy was a smart young lad, but eventually he got bored.

What do you get when you have a bored hacker?

Yeah, you guessed it.

Trouble.

That''s when I started playing with my space.

My space was the number one site on the internet, and all my friends had, and I sort of held off for a while, and then one day I said, okay, it''s pretty much all my friends have it, so I should just go on there and make an account, see what this is about.

And I made an account, I was like, oh, this is pretty cool, it''s a social network, you can post pictures, and you can post some people''s, I guess you call them profiles back then, and they didn''t have, you wouldn''t call them walls.

If you could have music that auto played, there''s just terrible.

You could do really awful CSS things to your page, but you could also do cool things.

And I really like that.

I actually really appreciate the fact that you could style the page in any way you want it.

You really could beam it and show a little personality.

I thought that was really cool and not something you get to do every day anymore.

So I made a profile, and at this point, pretty technically confident, or I felt that way.

and I thought, well, maybe I can make my profile cooler than some of my friends.

Just more interesting or unique.

So I started saying, all right, well, I could do all the CSS stuff, but how can I really do something interesting?

And I started looking and I think I had gotten like a digital camera and I found that the limitation on the profile pictures was, you can only have some photos.

And I thought it''d be funny just to have a 13th photo.

Like, it''s just a limitation that they had.

No one would really notice, you''d really have to think about it or know this limitation even to realize but I thought that would be sublimating.

funny.

Sammy figured out that the limitation on the number of photos that my space users were allowed to post was set by client side validation.

He realized he could bypass this validation and talk directly to the API server.

And he could submit as many photos as he wanted to my space.

And it worked.

Unbelievable.

So cool.

But now that he had bypassed one validation check, he wondered what What else could he do when you look at a Myspace users profile?

You can see what birthday they have displayed, what their favorite foods are, their music and movies, but there''s also a place to describe your relationship status.

There was a little drop down box.

You could pick single, married, engaged, or in a relationship, but you were bound to only be able to pick one of these that were in the drop down box.

There was no way to enter your own relationship status.

I wanted mine to say in a hot relationship.

That would be funny.

And again, a subtle change.

You couldn''t really do that.

At least back then with that version of CSS.

But I started playing around and said, well, maybe I can execute JavaScript.

Because JavaScript should be able to modify the DOM, modify the page in any way I want.

And I started playing around and found that they pretty much blocked JavaScript in any possible way.

So then I started saying, okay, well, maybe I can mess with the browser.

So I started looking to exploit the browser''s interpretation of tags and found that yes, there''s actually a way that I could execute JavaScript that technically isn''t compliant with say the W3C stack of how HTML should be interpreted, but browsers happen to be pretty lenient and they want web pages to work even if the developer made in there.

So I found a way to execute JavaScript within a CSS tag and then access some data somewhere else on the page and execute JavaScript note.

And this was really cool.

So this allowed me to now change my interrelationship to interrelationship.

Well, another fun and awesome win for Sammy.

At this point, he''s conducted two hacks against Myspace and is looking to see what else he can do.

He realized that when he changed the relationship status, he could get the browser to execute whatever JavaScript he wanted.

But it''s not just that, he could get whoever visited his profile to execute the JavaScript code that he wrote.

To be able to control the browser of whoever visits his page, this was a seriously big deal.

And at that point, it''s like, what else could I do that could be fun?

I started playing around.

I was just doing silly things.

I wanted to see, okay, if someone visited my profile and were not already friends, can I make them at me as a friend?

And I could.

And then I found, well, if I can control their browser, couldn''t I just update their own profile?

And I found, yeah, whenever they visit my profile, I could make them update anything on their profile.

And I didn''t want to be malicious.

I just wanted to do something that I thought was funny.

So I made it so that if you visit my profile, you''d not only would you add me as a friend, but then you would add most of all samis my hero to the bottom of your profile.

I thought that would be kind of funny and after a few days maybe a few of my friends would have it on their profiles and I could just be like hey cool you know point that out to them.

So I release this and a few days go by and nothing really happens like virtually none of my friends have hit it because a lot of people aren''t going to my profile.

So I think okay well how do I make this spread a little faster?

And I''m thinking, all right, if I can make you add me as a friend and add me as a hero to your profile, couldn''t I just copy the code to your profile as well?

So that way, if someone visits that profile, they''ll also add me as a friend, add me as a hero, and then the code will copy to their profile.

So within my friend group, it should probably hit them all within a week or so, and that will be pretty funny.

Someone will complain, and it''ll be taken down, and it''ll be good.

I launch it one night, and I go to sleep, and I wake up hoping to get at least a couple of hits, and unfortunately, I wake up to 10,000 new friends.

10,000 new friends?

Sammy was just trying to have some fun.

He didn''t intend to be malicious, But then it dawned on him.

He''s actually created a virus on my space.

Anyone who visited his profile would immediately add him as a friend.

But then the code to add Sammy as a friend was copied to that person''s profile.

So anyone who visited that person''s profile now had the code to add Sammy as a friend and it just kept spreading.

A virus that spreads itself like this is not just a virus.

It''s a worm.

Sammy has just created a MySpace worm, and it''s spreading way beyond what he thought it would become.

Perhaps he could get a few dozen friends, or even a hundred new friends.

But now he''s got 10,000 new friends, and it''s just constantly going up.

At that point, I just freak out.

I have no idea what to do.

I''m seeing my apartment, and I''m kind of baffled.

So I realized, oops, I just wrote a virus.

And what should I do?

And the problem with the virus is you can''t just remove it like I could remove it from my own profile But that doesn''t mean it''s gonna stop spreading because it''s already spread to thousands of profiles Where you get inflited with messages as well like, you know, you''re just really popular at the same time is having friends People were messaging me they''re like, hey, why are you on my profile?

Hey, every time I try to delete you You come back.

That''s because every time they would delete me from their profile It would return them to their own profile which re-excuted the code which reacted me as a friend So they couldn''t actually delete the virus either themselves, so they really needed my space to do that.

So at that point, I''m like, okay, it''s time for damage control as much as I can do.

So I email my space anonymously.

Hi, I''m a random user of my space.

I have no idea what''s going on.

There''s some weird stuff on my profile.

It looks like a bunch of obfuscated code, and I''m not really sure what it does.

But I think it does detailed explanation of exactly what was going on.

And I think you can fix it by, here''s a detailed explanation of exactly how to fix this problem.

I just prayed that they got it.

Well, I just continued my day.

I mean, at that point, I really couldn''t thank you, so I drove to the office.

In the whole time he''s at work, he''s looking at his Myspace profile and just watching the number of friends he has, rising higher and higher and higher.

150,000, 100,000.

I could not think about anything, I was just refreshing, went home, 500,000, 600,000.

And 600,000 knew my space friends.

Oh, this is going way out of control.

This has to be stopped.

Sammy tried to stop the worm by removing the code on his profile.

I removed the code from my own profile, but that doesn''t do anything, right?

It only removes it so that anyone who is my profile doesn''t get it, but it''s already spreading from anyone else, right?

Once someone else has it, it would just continue to spread.

So there''s no other way to really control it.

Really, my space would have to remember themselves.

Sammy goes off to work, does his shift, comes back home.

600,000, 700,000 it hits a million I just take a screenshot because now I''m just like that''s with a lot of people I had no idea that many people were even on my space.

I just had no idea how big it was I was hoping it would hit a hundred max Over the course of a week or a month or something once it was 10,000 I knew I had done something wrong.

That was I was like, oh, I did not think this through I was just freaked out the entire time.

I was super super concerned because I mean if it hit 10,000 overnight then at that point it was obvious oh yeah it''s just gonna grow ridiculously out of proportion and now I''m refreshing purely because I''m curious how fast it''s spreading so I''m refresh I refresh I refresh and at this point it''s spreading at about 3,000 people per second and as I''m sort of doing this little test of how fast it''s moving I refresh once again and finally my profile has been taken down so I''m pretty happy about this so then I was wondering okay the virus was probably up for about 20 hours.

And I''m thinking, all right, well, does it still say same as my hero and other people''s profiles?

Like, how did they take this down?

So I go to someone else''s profile.

And then I see that that profile is also down like, oh, no.

So I go to myspace.com, just to the website.

And it says, the whole site is down, the whole team is here working on it.

I felt absolutely awful.

I know what it''s like to have servers that are down and I would never want to do that to somebody.

And I''m thinking, okay, the number one site on the internet is down.

And I also recall that MySpace had just been purchased by Fox for half a billion dollars.

And I didn''t really want Fox to come after me.

So I was like, oh no, what do I do?

So I thought about it.

And MySpace is in LA.

So maybe I should just drive over there with some coffee and donuts and be like, hey guys, I''m Sammy.

I''m so sorry.

Can I help do anything?

Can I write some SQL queries?

What can I do?

But I thought that would be a bad idea.

In case they were just really upset, which I would totally understand is where I''d go to jail.

I had no idea what the ramifications of something like this was.

I really had no idea.

Did you tell anyone then?

What did your friends think of this at this point?

Because I mean, the people you work with and stuff, did they know that day?

Like, hey, it''s going crazy.

Your friends, did they know?

And you''re like, hey, and call one of them and say, I think I just took my space down.

I messaged like one or two friends about it.

I should remember explicitly one friend, I messaged just before doing it.

And he''s like, hey, don''t do that.

He was much smarter than I was.

And I think during the thing, I don''t think I''d talk to anyone about it.

My girlfriend, Gred told her, and she thought the whole thing was funny.

And really back then, it was just a social network, it was a small social network, really nothing compared to the networks we have today like Facebook and Twitter.

Granted, it was the largest of the time, but it was 2005, like smartphones had not come out.

There''s a much smaller people in the internet I just didn''t seem as serious.

At this point, my space is down, like the whole website.

Sammy is worried and scared.

The team at my space is probably totally freaking out.

This was the largest social networking site in the world at the time, and it''s down because Sammy decided to have a laugh?

This is not good.

Sammy''s anxiety is growing every minute that the site is down.

He can''t focus on real life right now.

Forget about work, forget about going out with friends.

was what the heck happened to my space?

Was it his worm that took down my space?

How much trouble would he be in if it was?

Hours went by and the site was still down and he was getting more and more anxious as he kept refreshing the page, weeding for it to come back up.

And then hours after the site went down, my space came back online.

Actually, I feel very good that the site is up a few hours later and this way I don''t really know what to do.

like sit around and we''ll start working on other things.

I''m kind of just waiting for the police to come knock on my door.

And a day goes by and a week goes by and I start getting emails from random people on the internet, blog writers and magazines that are like, hey, you know, we heard about the sperm you wrote.

I''m like, I don''t know what you''re talking about.

And they said, is your name Sammy?

I was like, yeah, my name''s Sammy, but you know, I''m not sure what you''re talking about.

And then they sent me a picture and they''re like, is this you?

And it''s my profile picture.

So It was, of course, it''s me and, like, okay, fine.

That was me.

And they started asking, you know, what was this spell?

Like, what was your intention?

This is just a prank on terribly wrong.

They asked, is my state content to you?

And I said, no.

Have the police contacted you?

I say, no.

And a week goes by, two weeks, three months.

Finally, after three months, I''m like, okay.

I''m super fortunate.

No one for my states or police or anything you ever have contacted me.

So, I''m really, really lucky.

I did something pretty dumb.

I''m never doing that again.

And sort of got away, it''s got free.

What a lesson learned, huh?

To accidentally take down the largest social network in the world and not hear from my space or the police, lucky guy.

Because you know what?

Sammy''s fingerprints are all over this worm.

I mean, the worm follows Sammy.

And then the worm actually says, above all, Sammy is my hero.

So it would be really easy for my space to track this back to Sammy, but nothing.

So Sammy just goes back to his regular life, back to his job at finality, which is starting to pay him even more now.

In fact, he was making enough to buy his dream car.

I got a Porsche boxer at the age of 19.

Anyway, he got a brand new car and one day he''s leaving his apartment and he goes down the elevator to the parking garage.

I''m walking down to it, but it''s a brand new car and I see two guys like this standing next to it sitting on it and I''m like oh no I''m getting card jacked and two more guys walk up behind me and then they say Sammy and I was like oh no I realized like card jackers they don''t know your name and they say Sammy we have a search warrant for you this was a surprise six months ago is when he launched a MySpace worm and now they''re coming for him these were representatives from the Secret Services Electronics Crimes Task Force, the LA District Attorney''s Office and the California Highway Patrol.

The highway patrol was there because they had suspicion that Sammy''s fancy new car might have been stolen.

The agents took Sammy into custody and head back up to his apartment.

We all walk up and as we go into my place, there''s a dozen agents already there going through everything.

And what they''re doing is they''re taking everything.

So anything that has data, CD, DVD, my laptop, my computer, my Xbox, and even my iPod was probably worse.

They took my iPod.

All my music was gone.

I loved music, so that was actually somewhat challenging.

Because all my MP3s and any legitimate or illegitimate music I had was gone.

And I was kind of terrified, but also, as someone go with the flow, you know, things happen in life, and you deal with them.

And I''m just waiting for sort of all this to be over, and now I''m reading Search One, because I really want to find out, Like, is this about my space?

Is this about something else?

Is this about some computers I hacked into?

I have no idea.

And I''m reading through, reading through, and then finally I see the words myspace.com.

Okay, good.

So it''s about that.

At least that one was a prank.

Then I''m reading, reading, reading, and then I see another address that they''re allowed to search.

And it''s my office.

So I asked them, are you guys gonna search my office?

They''re like, we''re already there.

One of the ages asked me, what''s that on your counter?

So in my living room, there was a table and it had some equipment on it, some smart card reader writer stuff and some smart cards stuff.

And it''s like, what are you doing with that?

And at this point, I think, okay, the Secret Service agent just asked me what these smart cards are.

And in my head, I''m like, should I tell them or should I lie about what this is?

And my friend was staying at my apartment for work at my company.

And I was showing him that I had to hack the laundry machines in our apartment building so that I could get free laundry.

And I was basically cloning smart cards or like replaying the information from a smart card to make it appear that it had more money than it did and I decided I should not lie to these people so I just told them that and fortunately they only just laughed and that''s nothing else came of that afterwards they collected everything and then they walked out and I''m like hey guys like are you taking me with you and they said no no you''re not under arrest at least for now and I said oh okay and they walked away and all of a sudden I just had no computers.

I went to the office.

Unfortunately, somehow the CEO was able to convince them that I was like an intern and that I had no access to anything, because when they came in, they said, hey, what to say?

I mean, can''t we have access to it?

The CEO was like, well, everything.

And they''re like, all right, guys, take everything.

This is a cloud-based company.

So when you take everything back then, we ran all the servers.

So they were about to take all of our servers, which would just bankrupt us instantly.

Fortunately, he convinced them something else that I was an intern or something weird, and they only took my stuff, just my computer, my phone.

And at that point, I got an attorney, and we ended up basically fighting with the LADA for about six months.

The Los Angeles DA charged Sammy with modifying data on a remote machine.

In settlement talks, prosecutors proposed that Sammy served some time in prison and not be able to use his computer for the rest of his life.

Keep in mind that Sammy was supporting his mother, and as a high school dropout, his only skill set in his livelihood We''re entirely dependent on using a computer.

Semi was so bright and gifted and passionate about computers and technology on the internet and hacking.

You can imagine how scary it was for him to face the prospect of having to live the rest of his life without ever being able to use a computer again.

Probably the hardest part, really the hardest part of anything I think, at least for me, is not knowing what an outcome will be.

I think it''s much easier to deal with, maybe even the most challenging outcome.

If I know that''s going to happen, you just tell me, okay, I''m going to go to the prison for the rest of my life, then I can at least mentally try to prepare for that.

But not knowing was just really difficult to deal with.

But ultimately, I took a plea agreement with them.

And the plea agreement was no prison time, so that was nice.

However, I would not be able to touch a computer for the rest of my life.

That was still in there.

And probation indefinitely, I would have to pay some restitution, I''d have to do a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

In fact, it also explicitly stated I could not access MySpace.com, so in case I somehow was able to access it without the internet of our computer.

So that was it.

Sammy had lost everything.

I mean, forget about the Porsche at this point, because on top of all this, they gave him a $20,000 fine.

So between having to pay all the lawyers and the fine and still having to support his mom, yeah, he was almost completely wiped out, almost back to zero, living as cheap as possible.

But still, forget all that.

I don''t think Sammy carried about the money at this point.

He was back to trying to figure out what he should do with his entire life.

No internet for life?

Everything he''s been working towards, all his skills and knowledge are useless now.

Sammy had 720 hours of community service he had to complete.

So every Saturday morning, he''d get up at 5 a.m. and go clean trash on the side of the highway for years.

Even if he did six hours every Saturday, that''s still just 300 hours a year, so everything about Sammy''s life was changed.

And he had to find new things to do that didn''t involve a computer to keep himself busy.

But I was really fortunate.

I mean, I met new people, I spent all that time just sort of doing other things that I had never really spent time doing.

I went outside, I saw the sun was like, ah, it''s so bright, but I got used to it.

that I made friends, I turned 21, so I get started going out meeting people, started learning to socialize a lot more.

So it''s really, really beneficial to me and something I wouldn''t really change today learned so much from that experience.

And I think it was good for someone so introverted and so stuck to a computer to be able to go out and experience other things.

So Sammy spent years of his life offline, doing his community service and trying to socialize with his friends.

But the story doesn''t end here.

After the break, Sammy gets to use computers again.

After two years of probation, Sammy has served all 720 hours of his community service.

He had great behavior.

The probation officer didn''t find anything wrong that Sammy did.

And since he had such great behavior, they went back to court to see if he could get the probation lifted.

And after a few years, I went back to court, and today, you know, my probation officer loves me.

It says I''m our favorite client, and they said, okay, you are a lot of touch computers again.

That was a very interesting experience.

I felt really weird touching the computer afterwards.

We kind of just get used to the rules that you''re abiding by, and it''s definitely an awkward feeling jumping back in.

What happens on that day that you got it back?

I definitely remember that day because I drove to the LA Courthouse and after I left the courthouse, I drove to the office store and found whatever the latest, you know, top of the line.

I don''t even think it was a MacBook.

It might have been a power book at that time.

I bought the top of the line power book and I went to a coffee shop.

I pulled it open and I connected to the Wi-Fi and I visited a couple of websites, so I think I visited the flash drive just to see what''s going on.

And I just felt really weird and I just shut the laptop and I went to go hang out with friends.

This started the next chapter in Sammy''s life.

Now that he was free to use the computer again, he eventually got back into it, way into it.

Even though he hadn''t been allowed to use a computer for the last two years, he had spent that time thinking of all sorts of things he can do with them.

During that time that I had no internet, I had no computers.

I started thinking about new exploits, new ways to really manipulate more systems and like exploit routers and exploit firewalls and just had some concepts literally just in my head and I couldn''t confirm whether they were accurate or not, whether they would work after I came back online.

And I started thinking, well, this stuff is fun.

Like maybe I can do this stuff, but not impact websites, not impact people negatively.

So how can I investigate the technology around us, look for the vulnerabilities around us and then share that information publicly in an entirely legal way so people actually understand the problems and can use solutions.

So just six months after Sammy had completed his probation for hacking my space, as 2008, Sammy was around 21 years old and starts looking into hacking credit cards, specifically the NFC and RFID chips on them.

Yeah, some other researchers and myself, we''re looking at these NFC credit cards which are becoming a lot more ubiquitous today but back then it was fun kind of funny they actually came out with these credit cards with NFC and pretty quickly they were encrypted somewhere encrypted however you could actually just buy a chip with the decryption key so you would just buy a chip from a company and you could then decrypt anyone''s credit card access their credit card info and then literally steal stuff with it and that was not my intention But I want to show that this stuff is not secure, so I just created a proof of concept that opened up this to some additional credit cards And there were some other tools that did similar things for other types of credit cards And I know mine was like a visa chase card that no one hadn''t done this for yet How close to someone do you have to be to get their credit card details?

Like does it work from far away?

I haven''t really experimented with how far you can do it So I''m not sure you do need to be close to them It''s very easy to be within proximity of many many people you just go to a crowded place and now you can see all many, many credit cards and then you can go home and buy a ton of stuff online or you can sell those credit cards online and really just steal money.

Even just bumping up against someone in the line, if they have an NFC or RFID vulnerable credit card in their pocket, that would be good enough to steal their credit card, right?

That''s correct.

That''s such a trip.

You know what''s funny is after releasing that and demonstrating that NFC then disappeared from our credit cards and it only recently re-emerged in the past few years and now with much stronger cryptography and additional safeguards from these sorts of tax.

However, there are other attacks.

I mean, it will always be cat and mouse right now.

Nothing is ever perfectly secure and to be fair, it''s much easier to be the attacker.

Well, Sammy studied how to hack the chips within credit cards.

He never did anything malicious with this.

He never actually stole anyone''s credit cards that he didn''t have permission to steal.

Instead, he started blogging about this and teaching others about the safety involved with these products in an attempt to make them more secure.

And from then on, Sammy would continue to research the security of so many more things, but always in an ethical and safe way.

He would do this on his own equipment and disclose what he found to vendors.

For instance, Sammy recently released a proof of concept to show how you can steal passwords and encryption keys by just listening.

This sort of stuff has been done for years by other people, by researchers, and I''m just trying to see can I do this on a two dollar chip or an Arduino that many people know how to use and many makers can just buy off the shelf and then they perform these types of attacks.

There''s a tax out there where researchers have demonstrated just taking a phone, a regular phone, putting it near a computer, and when a computer is doing some sort of cryptographic operation and maybe it''s encrypting an email, maybe it''s trying to send some Bitcoin, maybe it''s doing a financial transaction, maybe it''s logging into a bank.

When any of these things are being done and the processor is like processing those instructions in a certain order, Well, the processor requires power and different instructions require different amounts of power.

So, addition will be less power than a multiplication, which is really just a bunch of additions.

And you can then measure that power, but if you have a phone, you can use the microphone.

So, let''s say I''ve put a phone next to someone''s laptop and they''re encrypting an email with like the secret key.

Well, when that CPU is pulling power from all these capacitors, those capacitors are going through this thing called electro-strictive effect and they''re physically moving inside your computer and they''re moving at a speed, a rate against the circuit board inside that produces ultrasound.

You and I can''t hear ultrasound, but the phones that we have, the mobile devices we have, those microphones actually can listen all the way into the ultrasound range.

And if you have, say, an Android device with a microphone enabled and it listens to that ultrasound, you can then look at that sound, that amplitude or the volume of the sound, And then correlated and say, well, the higher the sound, the more power those capacitors are using and feeding to the CPU.

And if I know it''s this much power for this long, well, I can do timing and power analysis and say, well, that means you''re doing an addition here or you''re probably doing a jump or a branch here or a comparison here.

And this looks like you''re doing an AES encryption at 128 bit key.

And, you know, if you''re encrypting with a zero bit or so one bit, that''s going to take different instructions with different amount of power.

and then I can fully recover that key.

It''s pretty impressive.

And these are the types of attacks that are really explaining physical phenomena, right?

Things that a software developer might implement something perfectly, but there''s still these other attacks.

Sammy continued finding new areas to do security research in.

And at some point, he got interested in cookies.

Cookies are what web browsers use to remember who you are.

So when you return to a website, they can log you in or show you content that''s just for you.

So cookies are a tracking mechanism, and browser store these cookies on the user''s computer.

In a very specific location, but as Sammy looked into it, he was noticing some websites figured out a way to track users without storing the cookie in that traditional location.

For instance, some sites ran Flash to display fancy graphics.

Well, when you get to that website, the Flash video is downloaded and stored on your computer, and the next time you go to that website, your browser checks to see if you already have that video or if you need to download it.

But people were really concerned because some researchers found that some companies were using flash to store cookies on people''s computers.

And the benefit of this was that if a user deletes their normal cookies, their normal web browser or cookies, which is what advertisers used to track you, well, then the flash cookie was essentially acting as a backup, right?

And really serotoniously, because they obviously did that intentionally because they knew users might delete their omics.

And I was thinking, well, the browser was a pretty powerful piece of software until a lot of things.

I wonder what other mechanisms where I could actually store information locally.

And again, this is sort of a proof of concept to demonstrate what are all the ways that we can store information on a person''s computer whether they know it or not.

So I created this open source JavaScript library called EverCookie and it used normal cookies.

So it essentially generated random ID to track somebody.

And then you store it in their normal cookies, you store it in flash cookies.

But then I tried to find every possible other mechanism that you could use locally.

So there were silver lights.

So you silver light storage and then Java and HTML5 came out.

So then there was local storage and session storage, global storage, SQL light, local cache, your web history.

My friend Matt came up with a really cool idea of just storing the data in an image that would get cached.

And then you could actually read out the pixels of an image and then converted it back to an ID, all sorts of stuff.

And that was people like Matt and other people also started contributing to this project as it''s an entirely open source project on GitHub that that anyone can actually contribute to.

This ever cookie project that Sammy made really demonstrated how easy it is for websites to track their users even if they delete their cookies.

And this was a really effective technique.

So effective that when Snowden released a bunch of classified documents about what the NSA is doing, in there it even said that the NSA sometimes uses ever cookie to track its users through tour.

A couple people pointed out to me over the years that different governments have been using ever cookie to try to track people.

And it definitely feels good that a lot of governments are using my software, granted they''re doing it for a reason that I''m not into.

But I actually think the net gain of the entire project is extremely positive because whatever cookie really provided and still provides today is an asset test.

So now browsers essentially can use ever cookie to see, okay, does my private mode, does my incognito mode, does that provide the necessary protection to make get challenging to track this user, at least using local storage mechanisms.

And before ever cookie, there was nothing like that.

So no one knew about many of these techniques, and it''s very trivial for any company or government to then generate their own techniques.

But by consolidating it into a very simple to use the library, and always trying to keep it up to date, you know, people today are still updating ever cookie with new techniques.

Modern browsers that want to provide consumers and users and businesses privacy, it gives in that capability, because they know, okay, I''ve tested it at least against Evercooki, which is sort of state of the art and local storage mechanisms, and Evercooki can''t track it, so at least it makes it very difficult.

So governments who are using it, they''re really only able to track all browser users who don''t upgrade their browsers to operating systems.

Where people who actually do care about their privacy, those people typically know to use modern up-to-date software.

So I think the overall net gain is extremely beneficial.

Let''s talk about Skyjack then, because I think this is a really cool project.

What is Skyjack?

Skyjack started when I started hearing that Amazon was potentially going to use drones to deliver packages.

And I thought that was really cool, I mean, I think it''s really awesome that we have drones.

I think drones are super interesting, they''re low cost, and they''ll probably enable a lot of really useful things for humans.

However, I was somewhat concerned that that was the idea.

was like delivering just packages because I don''t really know if there''s any security on drones.

So I wasn''t sure I really didn''t know anything about drones so I went out and I bought the most ubiquitous consumer drone and then soon after I also bought industrial drones, type of drones that police use.

And immediately I started looking to see what are the protection mechanisms at least in the consumer drone and immediately I found absolutely zero.

Literally none.

You know one drone was using essentially Wi-Fi to be controlled and you could hijack that connection.

You could only have one person controlling the drone at a time, so if I would just essentially kick that person off and then I would take over and then I would modify the drone software so that the person could never log back in and then I would have full control and I found that I could do that and then I started looking at more industrial drones and found that they did have encryption.

However, that encryption was not good at all.

Basically, if you sat on a radio frequency channel, essentially it''s doing frequency hopping, So the transmitter is jumping around to different frequencies for various reasons, partially security, partially to prevent jamming or if there''s a lot of interference that interference will disappear after it hops to the next frequency.

But that was also based off the encryption key.

I found a packet sit on a single frequency and I see two packets come in from that drone, essentially it would have hopped hundreds of times.

And then I jump onto another frequency and I see it hopped on that frequency two times.

all of that would typically take a couple seconds tops.

I would then be able to reverse the key within a second.

I would be able to understand what the encryption key is and then I would be able to hop along and take over that drone as well.

So at that point I put all of this into an open source project called Skyjack.

I put on GitHub and I took a Raspberry Pi Linux computer.

I put my software on it.

I added some Wi-Fi transceivers and some sub-gigaheads transceivers for the industrial drones and you would then attach this Raspberry Pi to your own drone, and you''d fly your own drone around, and while you''re flying your drone around, Skyjack ever saw another drone on any of these wireless frequencies or within wireless range, it would then hijack and take over that drone, and you would now be in control of both drones.

In fact, any wireless drones found in the vicinity, you would take over all of them, and you''d be controlling a swarm of zombie drones entirely under your control from one transmitter.

And that was sort of the proof of concept there, and it was a really fun project, especially fun to be testing it.

Of course, I was testing only on my own drones that I owned, but it of course affected pretty much all models of old major drones at time.

No, I''ve flown a drone.

And one of those scariest feelings I''ve ever had is when you lose control of the thing and it just starts doing its own thing for whatever reason, right?

I mean, that''s a little bit evil what you''re doing here.

I''m not taking over anyone''s else''s drone.

I''ve only taken over my own.

Okay.

But giving the world the ability to do it, I don''t know.

I would disagree with that statement because the world has always had that capability of doing it, right?

How do you know people other people aren''t doing it already?

I would actually suspect that there are plenty of organizations who are doing it.

They''re just not going to tell you about it, right?

They''re not going to put it on the internet.

They''re not going to put it on GitHub and let you know that they''re taking over people''s drones or that they''ve developed the software and hardware necessary to do it.

They''re just going to create that and they''re going to stockpile it so that they can use it against people or companies or governments at their will.

That''s what we found when the NSA say leaks came out, we found out that they were stockpiling all of these vulnerabilities, including major, major vulnerabilities that affected many even the NSA that wants to protect America, knows that everyone''s running, say Windows computer, many people are running Windows computers, and they stockpiled Windows vulnerability zero days that nobody knew about.

It was only when one of these databases from the NSA was bleak that criminals were then able to use those exploits and actually attack many, many millions of computers around the internet, Americans and non-Americans, I don''t think it matters where you''re from.

So what I''m doing by releasing this stuff is demonstrating that, yes, this is the issue and you can patch it.

If I don''t release it, then the issue will continue to exist.

You might ask, well, why don''t I just directly communicate with the companies?

Often I do.

And I found over time that when you communicate directly with companies, they typically don''t resolve these sorts of things.

Unless you''re talking maybe existing, you know, specific software vulnerabilities in their architecture.

But if you''re saying, hey, you''re not using encryption or using like really wrong or it''s really the underlying protocol that is the issue.

I found that that''s when people don''t actually resolve anything.

And that''s when I started releasing stuff publicly and finding, oh, if you release a cool proof of concept that demonstrates the real problem, the underlying core problem, even if it''s not necessarily an issue with maybe the manufacturer, but rather a problem with the underlying protocol and just assumptions that were made, there is enough public pressure that causes that company to then resolve that issue due to the public pressure, not due to the vulnerability itself.

Because that''s often what companies are trying to do and no fault to them.

They''re trying to do what their customers want, right?

They''re trying to do what might move the needle for them.

And I found that this is an effective and appropriate way I believe to move the needle in a direction that I believe will help many people overall rather than just manufacture a company or a specific organization.

Has any company gotten upset with you and tried to come after you for some reason of disclosing vulnerabilities in their system publicly?

I''ve gotten seasoned assists many times, and it''s extremely fortunate that the EFF electronic frontier foundation, they have actually been very helpful to me, and they''re a nonprofit of attorneys who are really just looking for consumers and digital rights.

So your ability to have free speech online, your ability to inspect the software and hardware you use, the ability to own the things that you purchase.

I mean, there are companies who are trying to take this away from us.

But the EFF, I mean, really fortunate where they''ve defended me in some of these regards.

And so I''ve never had to succumb to and actually agree to assist to this day.

For the last decade, Sammy has continued to take on very interesting projects, hacking into stuff and exposing vulnerabilities.

Like another thing he found was that smartphones were tracking their users without their knowledge, which was a revelation that led to a class action lawsuit.

This all started because I was looking at I think a beta version of Firefox at the time.

And I was looking at the release notes and it talked about geolocation and I said cool that''s interesting like I''ve always been interested in location like being able to locate where someone is whether it''s on their cell phone or their computer or laptop or whatever.

And you know there''s always been these geo IP databases that sort of give you geography but really they''re or maybe accurate to the city, but often not.

And even city accuracy is not that great.

So I saw this thing about HTML5 geolocation and a Firefox data, and I started investigating, I wrote some code according to API of how it worked.

I ran it and all of a sudden, my browsers showed me exactly where I was.

Like literally, it showed me the physical address of my home.

And I was like, that''s absolutely crazy.

I''m on a laptop and my laptop does not have GPS.

I know that for a fact.

So how does it know where I am?

And I started sniffing the packets to see where it was going.

I mean, granted, you could just look at the source code.

It''s Firefox, so it''s open source.

And after sniffing, and I think maybe intercepting the TLS, I saw that it''s taking all of the wireless MAC address, all of the unique MAC addresses, all the routers around you, NAPs, and sending that to Google.

So even if your wireless routers are encrypted, and even if you don''t have one, and there are other people who have them, even if they''re encrypted, the MAC address is a unique identifier that isn''t unencrypted.

and your computer sends all of those to Google.

And Google returns the exact location that you''re located.

And you''re also sending only the wireless routers but the signal strength of each of them.

So then they can actually perform what''s called trilaterations, like triangulation, but essentially they use that signal strength and then really accurate this term where you are.

And I''m like, this is absolutely crazy.

How are they figuring all this out?

And I found that you''re basically sending all of these unique Mac addresses of all these routers around you and Google would send back.

your exact location.

So then I''m wondering, well, how does Google know where all these routers are?

And I thought about it some and I thought about some more and then I was, oh, there''s these Google Street View cars and these Google Street View cars are driving around and they have cameras on them and that''s where you get Street View from, right?

That really helpful feature of Google Maps where you can see like a Street View.

And I realized that they must have computers and like Wi-Fi systems on there that are also monitoring for these Wi-Fi Mac addresses and then correlating it with the GPS of the Street View Car and then uploading it all to Google and that''s how they''re getting this information.

It''s like that''s really clever.

And I started doing talks about this because I then found a way that I could essentially abuse that API and use it for myself whenever someone visit my website and I could see exactly where they were and I could even show them.

You''d come to my website, without your authorization, I could then send your Mac address and find where you are.

And I was talking about this in broader Slava and Slovakia and afterward someone said, say I mean, it''s interesting, but fortunately, you know, this does not apply to us because Google Street View cars are not allowed here.

Interesting.

So I''ll just give it a shot and try to running it, just confirm.

And oddly enough, it still worked.

It actually worked very accurately.

And it''s like, wait a second.

I don''t think Google''s lying.

I don''t believe that they are doing something illegal.

I don''t think they have Street View cars when they say they''re not doing that.

And you would notice, I mean, those cars stick out with with these massive sensors on top of them.

So what else might Google have access to, especially in somewhere random like Bratislava?

And I thought a little bit more and then realized, oh wait, Android phones.

There are Android phones everywhere.

And I wonder if these Android phones are actually we''re driving machines.

And after the reverse engineering, some binary blobs on Android devices, this was not actually in the source code that I could find.

I found these binaries that were essentially grabbing all Wi-Fi Mac addresses, is sending the signal strength of all these wireless routers up to Google along with GPS coordinates.

So essentially every Android phone in existence is a war driving machine for Google.

That''s grabbing all this information, grabbing all this location data.

So even if you don''t use an Android phone, other Android phones near you are then taking your routers information and sending it up with the location.

Sammy also figured out that iPhones were doing the same thing, but sending the data to Apple instead of Google.

And what''s worse is that in some cases, this was happening even after users turned off the location services or GPS.

Well, this was encrypted, so it took a little time to really understand what was going on in reverse engineering stuff.

And to really just demonstrate this as a fun proof of concept, I created a tool, really just a simple mobile app that behaved just like Google Maps.

And I found that Google was actually doing something really clever with their information, not only were they collecting where everyone was at all times via Android devices, but that''s also how they collect traffic.

So that''s how you know whether a street is green, yellow, or red, and whether there''s traffic or not in Google Maps is because all of the phones are constantly delivering their GPS location.

And if you time that, if you say, all right, I''m here now and in 10 seconds I''m here, well, you can calculate the distance they traveled over that time and know how fast they''re moving.

So that''s how they get Google Maps traffic.

So Sam, he thought about this for a minute and realized if the Android phones are the ones that are delivering data to Google and giving the traffic updates for the Google Maps, could he somehow exploit that?

Could he somehow trick Google servers into thinking there''s a traffic jam when there''s really not?

I created a app that was just like Google Maps and you''d start from point A and say, I''m at this location and I want to drive to wherever to West Hollywood.

And it would give you turn-by-turn directions.

But on those turn-by-turn directions of my route, it would sound only tangibly pretend to be thousands and thousands of other Android devices.

And all those devices, all those fake devices, would send up information to Google saying, hey, I''m one of these Android devices, and I''m moving zero miles per hour.

So all of a sudden, my route, the route that my app gave me, would turn red and black for everyone else, and they would get diverted to different routes on Google Maps.

And hopefully, my route would be a little bit faster as there would be less cars on the road.

And that was sort of my proof and concept to demonstrating this sort of this issue.

And I''ve some of this could even continue even when you turned off these features, like, location.

I love this hack.

To make it so wherever you drive, Google traffic is diverting drivers to go away from you because it''s congested wherever you are.

Even though it''s not congested where you are, you''re just sending fake data to Google.

It''s just brilliant.

Yeah, you know, it''s the proof of concept just to poke fun at the information and kind of just demonstrate like what this information is capable of doing.

While this is cool, the underlying issue here is that users were unknowingly sending their exact location to Google.

And I don''t know about you, but I don''t personally like that Google knows exactly where my phone is at all times.

I just think it''s a violation of privacy of some sort.

And you know what?

I''m not the only one who thinks that.

Yeah, so ultimately, you know, the biggest issue was that people weren''t accepting that A, they were sending all this data up.

So ultimately, Google and Apple had to appear on Capitol Hill because they previously said, no, we''re not tracking you.

And, you know, this research demonstrated that, yes, in fact, they were tracking exactly where you are virtually at all times.

And in some cases, it begins to your consent when you turned off location services on Apple.

Again, those devices were still sending information that allowed full location of where you were because it was sending Mac addresses, which they already knew where those were.

So it''s simply one step correlation in a database they already have.

So that''s not really fair to say that they''re not grabbing that information.

And ultimately, you know, they did resolve these things.

You know, it''s funny that the same thing is still happening, right?

All these phones are still doing the same things.

The only difference is now you click OK when they say they do it.

But the benefit here is that for people who don''t want this sort of technology to run, they can say no on their phone.

The scary thing, though, is that even if you don''t even have one of these phones, it''s all the phones around that are still collecting that information of your router, of the devices on your network, even though it''s somebody else''s device.

I saw a video the other day about a guy who put like a hundred Android cell phones all in a wagon and slowly walked down the road, and this triggered the Google location API thing to make it show that the road was really congested and made it turn red as well.

So it looks like this API is still under attack just by researchers and people doing weird stunts and stuff So yeah, Sammy has a pretty cool YouTube channel.

You should check that out And he''s also given a lot of talks at various conferences like she''s all over the world How many talks have you given at this point Sammy?

I don''t know maybe 50 or so Where are you working now and after all days?

I mean this is just such a whirlwind life you''ve had so far I''ve started a company called Open Path with some friends, and we''ve been growing quite a bit.

I''ve done some research in RFID and cloning badges, and being able to demonstrate how to break into buildings.

Many years ago, we found that technology has not changed in the 10 years since I''ve looked.

You know, wrote software that was able to clone badges and break into various levels of security for physical access for buildings.

And we were sitting around and thinking, well, you know, why is this still a problem?

And it''s still inconvenient.

Like, why do I have to carry around this thick card in my wallet?

like I''m trying to get rid of my wallet.

And we ended up building this business called Open Path where you could essentially have physical access control for businesses and buildings where, hey, you don''t need a card.

You could use a card if you wanted, but you could just use your phone.

Your phone actually has really strong encryption.

We have things like TLS, we have AES, we have open encryption standards that people have been trying to break for many, many years and haven''t that are entirely open and can be inspected by anyone.

So we''re using those technologies to essentially unlock doors and you don''t even need to pull your phone out.

You literally just get within Bluetooth range of one of these devices, then you can walk right in as long as you have authorization.

So we''re trying to really make a really modern and cloud-based and secure way of getting into buildings that is just really convenient because I''m just trying to get rid of the things in my wallet and this kind of technology is just really interesting.

Yes, that technology is interesting, but so much technology is interesting.

And we live in a time where technology is in abundance all around us.

And if you think about technology as much as Sammy does, it''s like a playground for him.

To be able to tinker with it all and take it apart and put it back together in ways it was never intended, Sammy''s hacker mindset is still going strong today and it will probably be strong for decades more to come, provided he doesn''t accidentally launch another warm and take down the largest social networking website once again.

A big thank you to Sammy Camcart for coming on and telling us all this.

Hey, it''s Jack, host of the show.

When I was a kid, I got an ant farm from my birthday.

It''s like two panes of glass with some sand in between and you can watch the ants dig tunnels and go about their day.

It was really cool, but when you get the ant farm, it doesn''t contain any ants.

You have to order the ants and they''re mailed to you.

And the first thing I thought about when I was a kid and I heard about this was, wait a minute, I can mail ants to anyone I want.

And I think that is basically the hacker mindset to completely ignore some things intended use and find new ways to employ it.

Today we''re going to talk with a hacker who sees the world this way and will hear all the joy and trouble it''s brought him over the years.

These are true stories from the dark side of the internet.

Okay, today we''re gonna have a chat with someone so infamous, he has his own worm named after him, the Sammy worm.

That''s right.

Today we''re talking with Sammy Camcar.

Sammy is a hacker in almost every way.

He does things he''s not supposed to do.

He''s the kind of guy that thinks buttons are toys and you push them for fun just to see what they do, which often ends up breaking something.

I was never malicious person at all.

So all this hacking, all of this exploitation, it''s really about a puzzle.

To me, this was all a puzzle, a really fun puzzle.

There''s a lot of reasons to call Sammy infamous.

But to tell his story, we need to go back to his childhood.

When I was nine years old, my mom bought me my first computer.

So I spent everything she had, so I''d have something to do during the summer.

She knew I lived computers.

I''d always go to the library with her or to her university and go and just spend all day at the library on the computers that they had.

And immediately I went online and I started searching for the ex files, which is obviously the best TV show of the time.

I found some message boards and that quickly became really frustrating to after a refresh and a wait for people to update that message board.

So then I found something called IRC, Internet Relay Chat.

And I jumped on, I went into a channel and said, hey, he wants a chat about the ex files.

and immediately someone told me, get out.

And I''m thinking, that''s weird.

This is like a random person I don''t know on the internet and they''re telling me to do something?

No. So I told the guy, no.

And then he said, you have 10 seconds to get out of this chapter.

And I said, no.

And 10 seconds later, the brand new computer that my mom spent everything on crashes.

I had a blue screen and I freaked out.

I had no idea what to do.

do.

I pulled the power from the back of the computer.

I waited about half an hour for all the bad stuff to get out of the computer.

I think that''s what you''re supposed to do.

And then I plugged it back in.

Unfortunately, it came back up.

Everything was fine.

But really with your adrenaline still rushing through my veins, I was thinking that is the coolest thing ever.

How do I do that?

From that point forward, Sammy was addicted to computers.

This was so fascinating to him.

He wanted to understand how this had been possible.

So he began studying computers and practicing programming.

Since he now had a computer at home, he got into video games too.

Counter-strike was his favorite game.

You know, the first person shooter, he played it a lot.

He was addicted to it.

It was fun.

I mean, it was a ton of fun.

I''ve had a clan and I was playing with a bunch of friends in high school and I remember just one day I was playing and I heard some footsteps.

My computer has two speakers, you know, one on the left side, one on the right side.

So some stereo sound and I hear some footsteps coming from the right speaker and then I hear them panning to the left speaker so that immediately tells me oh there''s someone behind me because I can''t see them in my visual field of view in the game.

So immediately I''m like wait, that means someone is behind me in the game.

This is a live person, someone else on the internet playing Counter Strike with me, but I can''t see them in my radar, which means they''re on the opposing team, so I wondered right then, couldn''t I really use that information, that sound information, on the computer itself?

I''m sure that person killed me pretty quickly, but afterwards I exited Counter Strike, and I started looking into how can I pull that information?

What''s telling the computer to play footsteps on the right speaker, rather than left speaker, because that means there''s positional information there that someone is on the right side versus the left side.

And sure enough, I started learning about packet sniffing and then memory injection and intercepting function calls within the DLLs of CounterStrike itself and intercepting basically everything between the binary, the CounterStrike executable and the DLLs that it used so that I could intercept things like footsteps.

And once I hooked that function, I was then able to get exact coordinates of everyone, because everyone''s footsteps is actually being sent to you.

At least within some range, you will then get that, and that''s just telling your computer where to play the sound.

But that location is exactly where that person''s located.

At that point, I started using OpenGL at the time, and just drawing where the user is on the map in a little heads-up display and a little radar.

And then I started jumping into writing counter-strike cheats software.

That was a lot of fun.

Where were some of the cheats you could do?

Just writing aim bots, so being automatically aiming at people, being able to make any smoke bomb or smoke grenade or flashbang, just make those transparent to me.

So I could go into a room that I knew is full of opposing team members and throw in a flashbang.

And they''re all going to see white for three seconds and I''m going to run in there and see absolutely nothing because I''ve hooked that function and said do nothing.

Just return out.

You know, do a return before you actually do any of the visualization to sort of wipe my screen.

and little things like that became really fun.

I couldn''t actually modify my health that was controlled by this server.

So I couldn''t actually make myself invincible, adding zoom to every weapon.

So weapons that didn''t normally have zoom or might have like a scope on them.

So you lose a lot of the screen because it''s now blacked out.

I would just remove those.

There''s no reason that it''s green to zoom blacked out.

I would remove that.

There''s no reason that zoom should be better in one weapon than not the other.

So I had to zoom to all weapons.

And this is all totally unfair.

and pretty quickly it actually became not fun at all.

Like all of the fun of the game went away entirely because all of a sudden it was practically god mode.

Sammy released the Counter Strike cheats as open source software.

He was beginning to get bored playing the game and then punk buster came out and punk buster is a program that''s designed to scan the memory to see if anyone is cheating in the game and punk buster stopped Sammy from using his cheats.

But now the new game was for Sammy to try to circumvent whatever punk buster was using to detect him.

All of a sudden this game was fun again, because I was no longer playing the game.

I was now playing against these engineers on punk buster.

They were doing their own memory inspection.

They were looking for my process.

They were doing all sorts of things to stop my cheats and other people''s cheats as well.

And that became fun.

At that point I was probably 15 years old.

So it''s so attached to this that I stopped going to high school and I started updating my cheats because this was just so fun and it would be cat and mouse.

So I would release a new version that defeated their software and two days later they would release a new version and then I would have to figure out what do they do, how do they figure it out.

And that was like training.

It was sort of very rapid training in how does at the very least software and networking work.

And I think I probably learned a ton just during that short stint when I was writing this cheats software.

at 16, you dropped out of high school, what did you do after that?

I wasn''t good at school.

I didn''t care about most classes, so I did not do well.

It was not a good learner.

No one ever taught me how to learn something.

I think that was something that I learned later in life.

I just wish there were tools that were taught at school for me.

I think I would have been a much better student.

However, if I''m enjoying something, then I will absolutely learn it.

I''ll spend all my time on it.

I''m still not necessarily a fast learner like I''ve always known that people can pick up stuff much faster than me But if there''s something I enjoy then I''m just gonna spend all my time on it and you know, I''m very persistent Sammy was living at home with his mom in Los Angeles at the time She had recently lost her job and now that she was home more often She noticed Sammy wasn''t going to school and told him if he''s not gonna go to school He needs to get a job to help pay the rent so Sammy started applying for any job he thought he could get.

I got an email out of the blue from a company in San Diego and said, hey, we saw your cheat software, your camera strike stuff.

And will you be willing to contract and just write code for us remotely?

And I was blown away.

I was like, wait, someone will pay me to write code.

Like, I thought this was just useful for basically writing cheat software.

Like, I had no idea that you could use it for other things.

I mean, it was obvious that you could sort of program things, but I just know someone would pay me money to do that.

So I was really, really fortunate in getting that email and I started working with them and just remotely writing code for them and they never met me.

I mean, never even talked on the phone.

It was just all over the email.

And they said, hey, do you want to move to San Diego and work full time with us?

And I said absolutely.

So I took my mom''s car and I just drove down and I met them and I think they were kind of weirded out because they didn''t expect a 15 year old to show up.

and they weren''t even sure if that was legal and I was like oh no don''t worry I looked into it it''s totally legal here''s a work permit that I got from my school which is really just a work permit I had forged and printed out and I just started working with this company down in San Diego and that was really cool and that allowed me to support myself and my mom and she continued to live in LA but I got to start my own life down there which is really great.

That is incredible.

And San Diego, as a teenager, Sammy was working as a programmer, but eventually took on the responsibilities of a systems administrator.

He was making pretty good money for his age, then someone in LA tried to recruit him to work at a startup, and this was the deal, quit your job and come work for us.

Initially, we can''t pay you, but you can have some equity in the company and sleep on a founder''s couch while the startup gets off the ground.

And I said, oh, thanks for that offer now.

Thank you.

And he said, well, what do you want to do with your life?

What do you want to do the next few years?

I thought that was a really good question.

I honestly had not thought about it.

This is not something I normally think about.

And I thought about it for a while.

And I was like, well, I want to learn how to start a company.

I want to learn how to start a successful company that employs people and works on cool projects.

He said, OK, well, I just sold my last company for $30 million cash.

I''ve started multiple companies, I''ve done this before, so why don''t you meet my co-founder and learn with me and you can handle the technical side and Thought about that for a second and it''s like well, I probably won''t get that opportunity ever again So I sort of jumped in and I said, okay, let''s do that We put my job in San Diego came back up to LA slept on his couch and that''s when we started a company called Flanality Finality was creating voice over IP solutions for companies.

Sammy wasn''t getting paid at first.

He had some savings but was blowing through it pretty quick and living as cheap as possible, sleeping on a couch.

But eventually the company started making money, which meant Sammy started getting paid.

Then I think after we were actually making money, because we had become profitable at some point, and then I had a salary and then that salary grew as we came more profitable and didn''t get more rounds and stuff.

So, at some point, I was really fortunate to be able to still support my mom and also have some nice toys.

Things were really looking good for Sammy at this point.

He was 19 years old, making great money at a company that he helped create.

Sammy was a smart young lad, but eventually he got bored.

What do you get when you have a bored hacker?

Yeah, you guessed it.

Trouble.

That''s when I started playing with my space.

My space was the number one site on the internet, and all my friends had, and I sort of held off for a while, and then one day I said, okay, it''s pretty much all my friends have it, so I should just go on there and make an account, see what this is about.

And I made an account, I was like, oh, this is pretty cool, it''s a social network, you can post pictures, and you can post some people''s, I guess you call them profiles back then, and they didn''t have, you wouldn''t call them walls.

If you could have music that auto played, there''s just terrible.

You could do really awful CSS things to your page, but you could also do cool things.

And I really like that.

I actually really appreciate the fact that you could style the page in any way you want it.

You really could beam it and show a little personality.

I thought that was really cool and not something you get to do every day anymore.

So I made a profile, and at this point, pretty technically confident, or I felt that way.

and I thought, well, maybe I can make my profile cooler than some of my friends.

Just more interesting or unique.

So I started saying, all right, well, I could do all the CSS stuff, but how can I really do something interesting?

And I started looking and I think I had gotten like a digital camera and I found that the limitation on the profile pictures was, you can only have some photos.

And I thought it''d be funny just to have a 13th photo.

Like, it''s just a limitation that they had.

No one would really notice, you''d really have to think about it or know this limitation even to realize but I thought that would be sublimating.

funny.

Sammy figured out that the limitation on the number of photos that my space users were allowed to post was set by client side validation.

He realized he could bypass this validation and talk directly to the API server.

And he could submit as many photos as he wanted to my space.

And it worked.

Unbelievable.

So cool.

But now that he had bypassed one validation check, he wondered what What else could he do when you look at a Myspace users profile?

You can see what birthday they have displayed, what their favorite foods are, their music and movies, but there''s also a place to describe your relationship status.

There was a little drop down box.

You could pick single, married, engaged, or in a relationship, but you were bound to only be able to pick one of these that were in the drop down box.

There was no way to enter your own relationship status.

I wanted mine to say in a hot relationship.

That would be funny.

And again, a subtle change.

You couldn''t really do that.

At least back then with that version of CSS.

But I started playing around and said, well, maybe I can execute JavaScript.

Because JavaScript should be able to modify the DOM, modify the page in any way I want.

And I started playing around and found that they pretty much blocked JavaScript in any possible way.

So then I started saying, okay, well, maybe I can mess with the browser.

So I started looking to exploit the browser''s interpretation of tags and found that yes, there''s actually a way that I could execute JavaScript that technically isn''t compliant with say the W3C stack of how HTML should be interpreted, but browsers happen to be pretty lenient and they want web pages to work even if the developer made in there.

So I found a way to execute JavaScript within a CSS tag and then access some data somewhere else on the page and execute JavaScript note.

And this was really cool.

So this allowed me to now change my interrelationship to interrelationship.

Well, another fun and awesome win for Sammy.

At this point, he''s conducted two hacks against Myspace and is looking to see what else he can do.

He realized that when he changed the relationship status, he could get the browser to execute whatever JavaScript he wanted.

But it''s not just that, he could get whoever visited his profile to execute the JavaScript code that he wrote.

To be able to control the browser of whoever visits his page, this was a seriously big deal.

And at that point, it''s like, what else could I do that could be fun?

I started playing around.

I was just doing silly things.

I wanted to see, okay, if someone visited my profile and were not already friends, can I make them at me as a friend?

And I could.

And then I found, well, if I can control their browser, couldn''t I just update their own profile?

And I found, yeah, whenever they visit my profile, I could make them update anything on their profile.

And I didn''t want to be malicious.

I just wanted to do something that I thought was funny.

So I made it so that if you visit my profile, you''d not only would you add me as a friend, but then you would add most of all samis my hero to the bottom of your profile.

I thought that would be kind of funny and after a few days maybe a few of my friends would have it on their profiles and I could just be like hey cool you know point that out to them.

So I release this and a few days go by and nothing really happens like virtually none of my friends have hit it because a lot of people aren''t going to my profile.

So I think okay well how do I make this spread a little faster?

And I''m thinking, all right, if I can make you add me as a friend and add me as a hero to your profile, couldn''t I just copy the code to your profile as well?

So that way, if someone visits that profile, they''ll also add me as a friend, add me as a hero, and then the code will copy to their profile.

So within my friend group, it should probably hit them all within a week or so, and that will be pretty funny.

Someone will complain, and it''ll be taken down, and it''ll be good.

I launch it one night, and I go to sleep, and I wake up hoping to get at least a couple of hits, and unfortunately, I wake up to 10,000 new friends.

10,000 new friends?

Sammy was just trying to have some fun.

He didn''t intend to be malicious, But then it dawned on him.

He''s actually created a virus on my space.

Anyone who visited his profile would immediately add him as a friend.

But then the code to add Sammy as a friend was copied to that person''s profile.

So anyone who visited that person''s profile now had the code to add Sammy as a friend and it just kept spreading.

A virus that spreads itself like this is not just a virus.

It''s a worm.

Sammy has just created a MySpace worm, and it''s spreading way beyond what he thought it would become.

Perhaps he could get a few dozen friends, or even a hundred new friends.

But now he''s got 10,000 new friends, and it''s just constantly going up.

At that point, I just freak out.

I have no idea what to do.

I''m seeing my apartment, and I''m kind of baffled.

So I realized, oops, I just wrote a virus.

And what should I do?

And the problem with the virus is you can''t just remove it like I could remove it from my own profile But that doesn''t mean it''s gonna stop spreading because it''s already spread to thousands of profiles Where you get inflited with messages as well like, you know, you''re just really popular at the same time is having friends People were messaging me they''re like, hey, why are you on my profile?

Hey, every time I try to delete you You come back.

That''s because every time they would delete me from their profile It would return them to their own profile which re-excuted the code which reacted me as a friend So they couldn''t actually delete the virus either themselves, so they really needed my space to do that.

So at that point, I''m like, okay, it''s time for damage control as much as I can do.

So I email my space anonymously.

Hi, I''m a random user of my space.

I have no idea what''s going on.

There''s some weird stuff on my profile.

It looks like a bunch of obfuscated code, and I''m not really sure what it does.

But I think it does detailed explanation of exactly what was going on.

And I think you can fix it by, here''s a detailed explanation of exactly how to fix this problem.

I just prayed that they got it.

Well, I just continued my day.

I mean, at that point, I really couldn''t thank you, so I drove to the office.

In the whole time he''s at work, he''s looking at his Myspace profile and just watching the number of friends he has, rising higher and higher and higher.

150,000, 100,000.

I could not think about anything, I was just refreshing, went home, 500,000, 600,000.

And 600,000 knew my space friends.

Oh, this is going way out of control.

This has to be stopped.

Sammy tried to stop the worm by removing the code on his profile.

I removed the code from my own profile, but that doesn''t do anything, right?

It only removes it so that anyone who is my profile doesn''t get it, but it''s already spreading from anyone else, right?

Once someone else has it, it would just continue to spread.

So there''s no other way to really control it.

Really, my space would have to remember themselves.

Sammy goes off to work, does his shift, comes back home.

600,000, 700,000 it hits a million I just take a screenshot because now I''m just like that''s with a lot of people I had no idea that many people were even on my space.

I just had no idea how big it was I was hoping it would hit a hundred max Over the course of a week or a month or something once it was 10,000 I knew I had done something wrong.

That was I was like, oh, I did not think this through I was just freaked out the entire time.

I was super super concerned because I mean if it hit 10,000 overnight then at that point it was obvious oh yeah it''s just gonna grow ridiculously out of proportion and now I''m refreshing purely because I''m curious how fast it''s spreading so I''m refresh I refresh I refresh and at this point it''s spreading at about 3,000 people per second and as I''m sort of doing this little test of how fast it''s moving I refresh once again and finally my profile has been taken down so I''m pretty happy about this so then I was wondering okay the virus was probably up for about 20 hours.

And I''m thinking, all right, well, does it still say same as my hero and other people''s profiles?

Like, how did they take this down?

So I go to someone else''s profile.

And then I see that that profile is also down like, oh, no.

So I go to myspace.com, just to the website.

And it says, the whole site is down, the whole team is here working on it.

I felt absolutely awful.

I know what it''s like to have servers that are down and I would never want to do that to somebody.

And I''m thinking, okay, the number one site on the internet is down.

And I also recall that MySpace had just been purchased by Fox for half a billion dollars.

And I didn''t really want Fox to come after me.

So I was like, oh no, what do I do?

So I thought about it.

And MySpace is in LA.

So maybe I should just drive over there with some coffee and donuts and be like, hey guys, I''m Sammy.

I''m so sorry.

Can I help do anything?

Can I write some SQL queries?

What can I do?

But I thought that would be a bad idea.

In case they were just really upset, which I would totally understand is where I''d go to jail.

I had no idea what the ramifications of something like this was.

I really had no idea.

Did you tell anyone then?

What did your friends think of this at this point?

Because I mean, the people you work with and stuff, did they know that day?

Like, hey, it''s going crazy.

Your friends, did they know?

And you''re like, hey, and call one of them and say, I think I just took my space down.

I messaged like one or two friends about it.

I should remember explicitly one friend, I messaged just before doing it.

And he''s like, hey, don''t do that.

He was much smarter than I was.

And I think during the thing, I don''t think I''d talk to anyone about it.

My girlfriend, Gred told her, and she thought the whole thing was funny.

And really back then, it was just a social network, it was a small social network, really nothing compared to the networks we have today like Facebook and Twitter.

Granted, it was the largest of the time, but it was 2005, like smartphones had not come out.

There''s a much smaller people in the internet I just didn''t seem as serious.

At this point, my space is down, like the whole website.

Sammy is worried and scared.

The team at my space is probably totally freaking out.

This was the largest social networking site in the world at the time, and it''s down because Sammy decided to have a laugh?

This is not good.

Sammy''s anxiety is growing every minute that the site is down.

He can''t focus on real life right now.

Forget about work, forget about going out with friends.

was what the heck happened to my space?

Was it his worm that took down my space?

How much trouble would he be in if it was?

Hours went by and the site was still down and he was getting more and more anxious as he kept refreshing the page, weeding for it to come back up.

And then hours after the site went down, my space came back online.

Actually, I feel very good that the site is up a few hours later and this way I don''t really know what to do.

like sit around and we''ll start working on other things.

I''m kind of just waiting for the police to come knock on my door.

And a day goes by and a week goes by and I start getting emails from random people on the internet, blog writers and magazines that are like, hey, you know, we heard about the sperm you wrote.

I''m like, I don''t know what you''re talking about.

And they said, is your name Sammy?

I was like, yeah, my name''s Sammy, but you know, I''m not sure what you''re talking about.

And then they sent me a picture and they''re like, is this you?

And it''s my profile picture.

So It was, of course, it''s me and, like, okay, fine.

That was me.

And they started asking, you know, what was this spell?

Like, what was your intention?

This is just a prank on terribly wrong.

They asked, is my state content to you?

And I said, no.

Have the police contacted you?

I say, no.

And a week goes by, two weeks, three months.

Finally, after three months, I''m like, okay.

I''m super fortunate.

No one for my states or police or anything you ever have contacted me.

So, I''m really, really lucky.

I did something pretty dumb.

I''m never doing that again.

And sort of got away, it''s got free.

What a lesson learned, huh?

To accidentally take down the largest social network in the world and not hear from my space or the police, lucky guy.

Because you know what?

Sammy''s fingerprints are all over this worm.

I mean, the worm follows Sammy.

And then the worm actually says, above all, Sammy is my hero.

So it would be really easy for my space to track this back to Sammy, but nothing.

So Sammy just goes back to his regular life, back to his job at finality, which is starting to pay him even more now.

In fact, he was making enough to buy his dream car.

I got a Porsche boxer at the age of 19.

Anyway, he got a brand new car and one day he''s leaving his apartment and he goes down the elevator to the parking garage.

I''m walking down to it, but it''s a brand new car and I see two guys like this standing next to it sitting on it and I''m like oh no I''m getting card jacked and two more guys walk up behind me and then they say Sammy and I was like oh no I realized like card jackers they don''t know your name and they say Sammy we have a search warrant for you this was a surprise six months ago is when he launched a MySpace worm and now they''re coming for him these were representatives from the Secret Services Electronics Crimes Task Force, the LA District Attorney''s Office and the California Highway Patrol.

The highway patrol was there because they had suspicion that Sammy''s fancy new car might have been stolen.

The agents took Sammy into custody and head back up to his apartment.

We all walk up and as we go into my place, there''s a dozen agents already there going through everything.

And what they''re doing is they''re taking everything.

So anything that has data, CD, DVD, my laptop, my computer, my Xbox, and even my iPod was probably worse.

They took my iPod.

All my music was gone.

I loved music, so that was actually somewhat challenging.

Because all my MP3s and any legitimate or illegitimate music I had was gone.

And I was kind of terrified, but also, as someone go with the flow, you know, things happen in life, and you deal with them.

And I''m just waiting for sort of all this to be over, and now I''m reading Search One, because I really want to find out, Like, is this about my space?

Is this about something else?

Is this about some computers I hacked into?

I have no idea.

And I''m reading through, reading through, and then finally I see the words myspace.com.

Okay, good.

So it''s about that.

At least that one was a prank.

Then I''m reading, reading, reading, and then I see another address that they''re allowed to search.

And it''s my office.

So I asked them, are you guys gonna search my office?

They''re like, we''re already there.

One of the ages asked me, what''s that on your counter?

So in my living room, there was a table and it had some equipment on it, some smart card reader writer stuff and some smart cards stuff.

And it''s like, what are you doing with that?

And at this point, I think, okay, the Secret Service agent just asked me what these smart cards are.

And in my head, I''m like, should I tell them or should I lie about what this is?

And my friend was staying at my apartment for work at my company.

And I was showing him that I had to hack the laundry machines in our apartment building so that I could get free laundry.

And I was basically cloning smart cards or like replaying the information from a smart card to make it appear that it had more money than it did and I decided I should not lie to these people so I just told them that and fortunately they only just laughed and that''s nothing else came of that afterwards they collected everything and then they walked out and I''m like hey guys like are you taking me with you and they said no no you''re not under arrest at least for now and I said oh okay and they walked away and all of a sudden I just had no computers.

I went to the office.

Unfortunately, somehow the CEO was able to convince them that I was like an intern and that I had no access to anything, because when they came in, they said, hey, what to say?

I mean, can''t we have access to it?

The CEO was like, well, everything.

And they''re like, all right, guys, take everything.

This is a cloud-based company.

So when you take everything back then, we ran all the servers.

So they were about to take all of our servers, which would just bankrupt us instantly.

Fortunately, he convinced them something else that I was an intern or something weird, and they only took my stuff, just my computer, my phone.

And at that point, I got an attorney, and we ended up basically fighting with the LADA for about six months.

The Los Angeles DA charged Sammy with modifying data on a remote machine.

In settlement talks, prosecutors proposed that Sammy served some time in prison and not be able to use his computer for the rest of his life.

Keep in mind that Sammy was supporting his mother, and as a high school dropout, his only skill set in his livelihood We''re entirely dependent on using a computer.

Semi was so bright and gifted and passionate about computers and technology on the internet and hacking.

You can imagine how scary it was for him to face the prospect of having to live the rest of his life without ever being able to use a computer again.

Probably the hardest part, really the hardest part of anything I think, at least for me, is not knowing what an outcome will be.

I think it''s much easier to deal with, maybe even the most challenging outcome.

If I know that''s going to happen, you just tell me, okay, I''m going to go to the prison for the rest of my life, then I can at least mentally try to prepare for that.

But not knowing was just really difficult to deal with.

But ultimately, I took a plea agreement with them.

And the plea agreement was no prison time, so that was nice.

However, I would not be able to touch a computer for the rest of my life.

That was still in there.

And probation indefinitely, I would have to pay some restitution, I''d have to do a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

In fact, it also explicitly stated I could not access MySpace.com, so in case I somehow was able to access it without the internet of our computer.

So that was it.

Sammy had lost everything.

I mean, forget about the Porsche at this point, because on top of all this, they gave him a $20,000 fine.

So between having to pay all the lawyers and the fine and still having to support his mom, yeah, he was almost completely wiped out, almost back to zero, living as cheap as possible.

But still, forget all that.

I don''t think Sammy carried about the money at this point.

He was back to trying to figure out what he should do with his entire life.

No internet for life?

Everything he''s been working towards, all his skills and knowledge are useless now.

Sammy had 720 hours of community service he had to complete.

So every Saturday morning, he''d get up at 5 a.m. and go clean trash on the side of the highway for years.

Even if he did six hours every Saturday, that''s still just 300 hours a year, so everything about Sammy''s life was changed.

And he had to find new things to do that didn''t involve a computer to keep himself busy.

But I was really fortunate.

I mean, I met new people, I spent all that time just sort of doing other things that I had never really spent time doing.

I went outside, I saw the sun was like, ah, it''s so bright, but I got used to it.

that I made friends, I turned 21, so I get started going out meeting people, started learning to socialize a lot more.

So it''s really, really beneficial to me and something I wouldn''t really change today learned so much from that experience.

And I think it was good for someone so introverted and so stuck to a computer to be able to go out and experience other things.

So Sammy spent years of his life offline, doing his community service and trying to socialize with his friends.

But the story doesn''t end here.

After the break, Sammy gets to use computers again.

After two years of probation, Sammy has served all 720 hours of his community service.

He had great behavior.

The probation officer didn''t find anything wrong that Sammy did.

And since he had such great behavior, they went back to court to see if he could get the probation lifted.

And after a few years, I went back to court, and today, you know, my probation officer loves me.

It says I''m our favorite client, and they said, okay, you are a lot of touch computers again.

That was a very interesting experience.

I felt really weird touching the computer afterwards.

We kind of just get used to the rules that you''re abiding by, and it''s definitely an awkward feeling jumping back in.

What happens on that day that you got it back?

I definitely remember that day because I drove to the LA Courthouse and after I left the courthouse, I drove to the office store and found whatever the latest, you know, top of the line.

I don''t even think it was a MacBook.

It might have been a power book at that time.

I bought the top of the line power book and I went to a coffee shop.

I pulled it open and I connected to the Wi-Fi and I visited a couple of websites, so I think I visited the flash drive just to see what''s going on.

And I just felt really weird and I just shut the laptop and I went to go hang out with friends.

This started the next chapter in Sammy''s life.

Now that he was free to use the computer again, he eventually got back into it, way into it.

Even though he hadn''t been allowed to use a computer for the last two years, he had spent that time thinking of all sorts of things he can do with them.

During that time that I had no internet, I had no computers.

I started thinking about new exploits, new ways to really manipulate more systems and like exploit routers and exploit firewalls and just had some concepts literally just in my head and I couldn''t confirm whether they were accurate or not, whether they would work after I came back online.

And I started thinking, well, this stuff is fun.

Like maybe I can do this stuff, but not impact websites, not impact people negatively.

So how can I investigate the technology around us, look for the vulnerabilities around us and then share that information publicly in an entirely legal way so people actually understand the problems and can use solutions.

So just six months after Sammy had completed his probation for hacking my space, as 2008, Sammy was around 21 years old and starts looking into hacking credit cards, specifically the NFC and RFID chips on them.

Yeah, some other researchers and myself, we''re looking at these NFC credit cards which are becoming a lot more ubiquitous today but back then it was fun kind of funny they actually came out with these credit cards with NFC and pretty quickly they were encrypted somewhere encrypted however you could actually just buy a chip with the decryption key so you would just buy a chip from a company and you could then decrypt anyone''s credit card access their credit card info and then literally steal stuff with it and that was not my intention But I want to show that this stuff is not secure, so I just created a proof of concept that opened up this to some additional credit cards And there were some other tools that did similar things for other types of credit cards And I know mine was like a visa chase card that no one hadn''t done this for yet How close to someone do you have to be to get their credit card details?

Like does it work from far away?

I haven''t really experimented with how far you can do it So I''m not sure you do need to be close to them It''s very easy to be within proximity of many many people you just go to a crowded place and now you can see all many, many credit cards and then you can go home and buy a ton of stuff online or you can sell those credit cards online and really just steal money.

Even just bumping up against someone in the line, if they have an NFC or RFID vulnerable credit card in their pocket, that would be good enough to steal their credit card, right?

That''s correct.

That''s such a trip.

You know what''s funny is after releasing that and demonstrating that NFC then disappeared from our credit cards and it only recently re-emerged in the past few years and now with much stronger cryptography and additional safeguards from these sorts of tax.

However, there are other attacks.

I mean, it will always be cat and mouse right now.

Nothing is ever perfectly secure and to be fair, it''s much easier to be the attacker.

Well, Sammy studied how to hack the chips within credit cards.

He never did anything malicious with this.

He never actually stole anyone''s credit cards that he didn''t have permission to steal.

Instead, he started blogging about this and teaching others about the safety involved with these products in an attempt to make them more secure.

And from then on, Sammy would continue to research the security of so many more things, but always in an ethical and safe way.

He would do this on his own equipment and disclose what he found to vendors.

For instance, Sammy recently released a proof of concept to show how you can steal passwords and encryption keys by just listening.

This sort of stuff has been done for years by other people, by researchers, and I''m just trying to see can I do this on a two dollar chip or an Arduino that many people know how to use and many makers can just buy off the shelf and then they perform these types of attacks.

There''s a tax out there where researchers have demonstrated just taking a phone, a regular phone, putting it near a computer, and when a computer is doing some sort of cryptographic operation and maybe it''s encrypting an email, maybe it''s trying to send some Bitcoin, maybe it''s doing a financial transaction, maybe it''s logging into a bank.

When any of these things are being done and the processor is like processing those instructions in a certain order, Well, the processor requires power and different instructions require different amounts of power.

So, addition will be less power than a multiplication, which is really just a bunch of additions.

And you can then measure that power, but if you have a phone, you can use the microphone.

So, let''s say I''ve put a phone next to someone''s laptop and they''re encrypting an email with like the secret key.

Well, when that CPU is pulling power from all these capacitors, those capacitors are going through this thing called electro-strictive effect and they''re physically moving inside your computer and they''re moving at a speed, a rate against the circuit board inside that produces ultrasound.

You and I can''t hear ultrasound, but the phones that we have, the mobile devices we have, those microphones actually can listen all the way into the ultrasound range.

And if you have, say, an Android device with a microphone enabled and it listens to that ultrasound, you can then look at that sound, that amplitude or the volume of the sound, And then correlated and say, well, the higher the sound, the more power those capacitors are using and feeding to the CPU.

And if I know it''s this much power for this long, well, I can do timing and power analysis and say, well, that means you''re doing an addition here or you''re probably doing a jump or a branch here or a comparison here.

And this looks like you''re doing an AES encryption at 128 bit key.

And, you know, if you''re encrypting with a zero bit or so one bit, that''s going to take different instructions with different amount of power.

and then I can fully recover that key.

It''s pretty impressive.

And these are the types of attacks that are really explaining physical phenomena, right?

Things that a software developer might implement something perfectly, but there''s still these other attacks.

Sammy continued finding new areas to do security research in.

And at some point, he got interested in cookies.

Cookies are what web browsers use to remember who you are.

So when you return to a website, they can log you in or show you content that''s just for you.

So cookies are a tracking mechanism, and browser store these cookies on the user''s computer.

In a very specific location, but as Sammy looked into it, he was noticing some websites figured out a way to track users without storing the cookie in that traditional location.

For instance, some sites ran Flash to display fancy graphics.

Well, when you get to that website, the Flash video is downloaded and stored on your computer, and the next time you go to that website, your browser checks to see if you already have that video or if you need to download it.

But people were really concerned because some researchers found that some companies were using flash to store cookies on people''s computers.

And the benefit of this was that if a user deletes their normal cookies, their normal web browser or cookies, which is what advertisers used to track you, well, then the flash cookie was essentially acting as a backup, right?

And really serotoniously, because they obviously did that intentionally because they knew users might delete their omics.

And I was thinking, well, the browser was a pretty powerful piece of software until a lot of things.

I wonder what other mechanisms where I could actually store information locally.

And again, this is sort of a proof of concept to demonstrate what are all the ways that we can store information on a person''s computer whether they know it or not.

So I created this open source JavaScript library called EverCookie and it used normal cookies.

So it essentially generated random ID to track somebody.

And then you store it in their normal cookies, you store it in flash cookies.

But then I tried to find every possible other mechanism that you could use locally.

So there were silver lights.

So you silver light storage and then Java and HTML5 came out.

So then there was local storage and session storage, global storage, SQL light, local cache, your web history.

My friend Matt came up with a really cool idea of just storing the data in an image that would get cached.

And then you could actually read out the pixels of an image and then converted it back to an ID, all sorts of stuff.

And that was people like Matt and other people also started contributing to this project as it''s an entirely open source project on GitHub that that anyone can actually contribute to.

This ever cookie project that Sammy made really demonstrated how easy it is for websites to track their users even if they delete their cookies.

And this was a really effective technique.

So effective that when Snowden released a bunch of classified documents about what the NSA is doing, in there it even said that the NSA sometimes uses ever cookie to track its users through tour.

A couple people pointed out to me over the years that different governments have been using ever cookie to try to track people.

And it definitely feels good that a lot of governments are using my software, granted they''re doing it for a reason that I''m not into.

But I actually think the net gain of the entire project is extremely positive because whatever cookie really provided and still provides today is an asset test.

So now browsers essentially can use ever cookie to see, okay, does my private mode, does my incognito mode, does that provide the necessary protection to make get challenging to track this user, at least using local storage mechanisms.

And before ever cookie, there was nothing like that.

So no one knew about many of these techniques, and it''s very trivial for any company or government to then generate their own techniques.

But by consolidating it into a very simple to use the library, and always trying to keep it up to date, you know, people today are still updating ever cookie with new techniques.

Modern browsers that want to provide consumers and users and businesses privacy, it gives in that capability, because they know, okay, I''ve tested it at least against Evercooki, which is sort of state of the art and local storage mechanisms, and Evercooki can''t track it, so at least it makes it very difficult.

So governments who are using it, they''re really only able to track all browser users who don''t upgrade their browsers to operating systems.

Where people who actually do care about their privacy, those people typically know to use modern up-to-date software.

So I think the overall net gain is extremely beneficial.

Let''s talk about Skyjack then, because I think this is a really cool project.

What is Skyjack?

Skyjack started when I started hearing that Amazon was potentially going to use drones to deliver packages.

And I thought that was really cool, I mean, I think it''s really awesome that we have drones.

I think drones are super interesting, they''re low cost, and they''ll probably enable a lot of really useful things for humans.

However, I was somewhat concerned that that was the idea.

was like delivering just packages because I don''t really know if there''s any security on drones.

So I wasn''t sure I really didn''t know anything about drones so I went out and I bought the most ubiquitous consumer drone and then soon after I also bought industrial drones, type of drones that police use.

And immediately I started looking to see what are the protection mechanisms at least in the consumer drone and immediately I found absolutely zero.

Literally none.

You know one drone was using essentially Wi-Fi to be controlled and you could hijack that connection.

You could only have one person controlling the drone at a time, so if I would just essentially kick that person off and then I would take over and then I would modify the drone software so that the person could never log back in and then I would have full control and I found that I could do that and then I started looking at more industrial drones and found that they did have encryption.

However, that encryption was not good at all.

Basically, if you sat on a radio frequency channel, essentially it''s doing frequency hopping, So the transmitter is jumping around to different frequencies for various reasons, partially security, partially to prevent jamming or if there''s a lot of interference that interference will disappear after it hops to the next frequency.

But that was also based off the encryption key.

I found a packet sit on a single frequency and I see two packets come in from that drone, essentially it would have hopped hundreds of times.

And then I jump onto another frequency and I see it hopped on that frequency two times.

all of that would typically take a couple seconds tops.

I would then be able to reverse the key within a second.

I would be able to understand what the encryption key is and then I would be able to hop along and take over that drone as well.

So at that point I put all of this into an open source project called Skyjack.

I put on GitHub and I took a Raspberry Pi Linux computer.

I put my software on it.

I added some Wi-Fi transceivers and some sub-gigaheads transceivers for the industrial drones and you would then attach this Raspberry Pi to your own drone, and you''d fly your own drone around, and while you''re flying your drone around, Skyjack ever saw another drone on any of these wireless frequencies or within wireless range, it would then hijack and take over that drone, and you would now be in control of both drones.

In fact, any wireless drones found in the vicinity, you would take over all of them, and you''d be controlling a swarm of zombie drones entirely under your control from one transmitter.

And that was sort of the proof of concept there, and it was a really fun project, especially fun to be testing it.

Of course, I was testing only on my own drones that I owned, but it of course affected pretty much all models of old major drones at time.

No, I''ve flown a drone.

And one of those scariest feelings I''ve ever had is when you lose control of the thing and it just starts doing its own thing for whatever reason, right?

I mean, that''s a little bit evil what you''re doing here.

I''m not taking over anyone''s else''s drone.

I''ve only taken over my own.

Okay.

But giving the world the ability to do it, I don''t know.

I would disagree with that statement because the world has always had that capability of doing it, right?

How do you know people other people aren''t doing it already?

I would actually suspect that there are plenty of organizations who are doing it.

They''re just not going to tell you about it, right?

They''re not going to put it on the internet.

They''re not going to put it on GitHub and let you know that they''re taking over people''s drones or that they''ve developed the software and hardware necessary to do it.

They''re just going to create that and they''re going to stockpile it so that they can use it against people or companies or governments at their will.

That''s what we found when the NSA say leaks came out, we found out that they were stockpiling all of these vulnerabilities, including major, major vulnerabilities that affected many even the NSA that wants to protect America, knows that everyone''s running, say Windows computer, many people are running Windows computers, and they stockpiled Windows vulnerability zero days that nobody knew about.

It was only when one of these databases from the NSA was bleak that criminals were then able to use those exploits and actually attack many, many millions of computers around the internet, Americans and non-Americans, I don''t think it matters where you''re from.

So what I''m doing by releasing this stuff is demonstrating that, yes, this is the issue and you can patch it.

If I don''t release it, then the issue will continue to exist.

You might ask, well, why don''t I just directly communicate with the companies?

Often I do.

And I found over time that when you communicate directly with companies, they typically don''t resolve these sorts of things.

Unless you''re talking maybe existing, you know, specific software vulnerabilities in their architecture.

But if you''re saying, hey, you''re not using encryption or using like really wrong or it''s really the underlying protocol that is the issue.

I found that that''s when people don''t actually resolve anything.

And that''s when I started releasing stuff publicly and finding, oh, if you release a cool proof of concept that demonstrates the real problem, the underlying core problem, even if it''s not necessarily an issue with maybe the manufacturer, but rather a problem with the underlying protocol and just assumptions that were made, there is enough public pressure that causes that company to then resolve that issue due to the public pressure, not due to the vulnerability itself.

Because that''s often what companies are trying to do and no fault to them.

They''re trying to do what their customers want, right?

They''re trying to do what might move the needle for them.

And I found that this is an effective and appropriate way I believe to move the needle in a direction that I believe will help many people overall rather than just manufacture a company or a specific organization.

Has any company gotten upset with you and tried to come after you for some reason of disclosing vulnerabilities in their system publicly?

I''ve gotten seasoned assists many times, and it''s extremely fortunate that the EFF electronic frontier foundation, they have actually been very helpful to me, and they''re a nonprofit of attorneys who are really just looking for consumers and digital rights.

So your ability to have free speech online, your ability to inspect the software and hardware you use, the ability to own the things that you purchase.

I mean, there are companies who are trying to take this away from us.

But the EFF, I mean, really fortunate where they''ve defended me in some of these regards.

And so I''ve never had to succumb to and actually agree to assist to this day.

For the last decade, Sammy has continued to take on very interesting projects, hacking into stuff and exposing vulnerabilities.

Like another thing he found was that smartphones were tracking their users without their knowledge, which was a revelation that led to a class action lawsuit.

This all started because I was looking at I think a beta version of Firefox at the time.

And I was looking at the release notes and it talked about geolocation and I said cool that''s interesting like I''ve always been interested in location like being able to locate where someone is whether it''s on their cell phone or their computer or laptop or whatever.

And you know there''s always been these geo IP databases that sort of give you geography but really they''re or maybe accurate to the city, but often not.

And even city accuracy is not that great.

So I saw this thing about HTML5 geolocation and a Firefox data, and I started investigating, I wrote some code according to API of how it worked.

I ran it and all of a sudden, my browsers showed me exactly where I was.

Like literally, it showed me the physical address of my home.

And I was like, that''s absolutely crazy.

I''m on a laptop and my laptop does not have GPS.

I know that for a fact.

So how does it know where I am?

And I started sniffing the packets to see where it was going.

I mean, granted, you could just look at the source code.

It''s Firefox, so it''s open source.

And after sniffing, and I think maybe intercepting the TLS, I saw that it''s taking all of the wireless MAC address, all of the unique MAC addresses, all the routers around you, NAPs, and sending that to Google.

So even if your wireless routers are encrypted, and even if you don''t have one, and there are other people who have them, even if they''re encrypted, the MAC address is a unique identifier that isn''t unencrypted.

and your computer sends all of those to Google.

And Google returns the exact location that you''re located.

And you''re also sending only the wireless routers but the signal strength of each of them.

So then they can actually perform what''s called trilaterations, like triangulation, but essentially they use that signal strength and then really accurate this term where you are.

And I''m like, this is absolutely crazy.

How are they figuring all this out?

And I found that you''re basically sending all of these unique Mac addresses of all these routers around you and Google would send back.

your exact location.

So then I''m wondering, well, how does Google know where all these routers are?

And I thought about it some and I thought about some more and then I was, oh, there''s these Google Street View cars and these Google Street View cars are driving around and they have cameras on them and that''s where you get Street View from, right?

That really helpful feature of Google Maps where you can see like a Street View.

And I realized that they must have computers and like Wi-Fi systems on there that are also monitoring for these Wi-Fi Mac addresses and then correlating it with the GPS of the Street View Car and then uploading it all to Google and that''s how they''re getting this information.

It''s like that''s really clever.

And I started doing talks about this because I then found a way that I could essentially abuse that API and use it for myself whenever someone visit my website and I could see exactly where they were and I could even show them.

You''d come to my website, without your authorization, I could then send your Mac address and find where you are.

And I was talking about this in broader Slava and Slovakia and afterward someone said, say I mean, it''s interesting, but fortunately, you know, this does not apply to us because Google Street View cars are not allowed here.

Interesting.

So I''ll just give it a shot and try to running it, just confirm.

And oddly enough, it still worked.

It actually worked very accurately.

And it''s like, wait a second.

I don''t think Google''s lying.

I don''t believe that they are doing something illegal.

I don''t think they have Street View cars when they say they''re not doing that.

And you would notice, I mean, those cars stick out with with these massive sensors on top of them.

So what else might Google have access to, especially in somewhere random like Bratislava?

And I thought a little bit more and then realized, oh wait, Android phones.

There are Android phones everywhere.

And I wonder if these Android phones are actually we''re driving machines.

And after the reverse engineering, some binary blobs on Android devices, this was not actually in the source code that I could find.

I found these binaries that were essentially grabbing all Wi-Fi Mac addresses, is sending the signal strength of all these wireless routers up to Google along with GPS coordinates.

So essentially every Android phone in existence is a war driving machine for Google.

That''s grabbing all this information, grabbing all this location data.

So even if you don''t use an Android phone, other Android phones near you are then taking your routers information and sending it up with the location.

Sammy also figured out that iPhones were doing the same thing, but sending the data to Apple instead of Google.

And what''s worse is that in some cases, this was happening even after users turned off the location services or GPS.

Well, this was encrypted, so it took a little time to really understand what was going on in reverse engineering stuff.

And to really just demonstrate this as a fun proof of concept, I created a tool, really just a simple mobile app that behaved just like Google Maps.

And I found that Google was actually doing something really clever with their information, not only were they collecting where everyone was at all times via Android devices, but that''s also how they collect traffic.

So that''s how you know whether a street is green, yellow, or red, and whether there''s traffic or not in Google Maps is because all of the phones are constantly delivering their GPS location.

And if you time that, if you say, all right, I''m here now and in 10 seconds I''m here, well, you can calculate the distance they traveled over that time and know how fast they''re moving.

So that''s how they get Google Maps traffic.

So Sam, he thought about this for a minute and realized if the Android phones are the ones that are delivering data to Google and giving the traffic updates for the Google Maps, could he somehow exploit that?

Could he somehow trick Google servers into thinking there''s a traffic jam when there''s really not?

I created a app that was just like Google Maps and you''d start from point A and say, I''m at this location and I want to drive to wherever to West Hollywood.

And it would give you turn-by-turn directions.

But on those turn-by-turn directions of my route, it would sound only tangibly pretend to be thousands and thousands of other Android devices.

And all those devices, all those fake devices, would send up information to Google saying, hey, I''m one of these Android devices, and I''m moving zero miles per hour.

So all of a sudden, my route, the route that my app gave me, would turn red and black for everyone else, and they would get diverted to different routes on Google Maps.

And hopefully, my route would be a little bit faster as there would be less cars on the road.

And that was sort of my proof and concept to demonstrating this sort of this issue.

And I''ve some of this could even continue even when you turned off these features, like, location.

I love this hack.

To make it so wherever you drive, Google traffic is diverting drivers to go away from you because it''s congested wherever you are.

Even though it''s not congested where you are, you''re just sending fake data to Google.

It''s just brilliant.

Yeah, you know, it''s the proof of concept just to poke fun at the information and kind of just demonstrate like what this information is capable of doing.

While this is cool, the underlying issue here is that users were unknowingly sending their exact location to Google.

And I don''t know about you, but I don''t personally like that Google knows exactly where my phone is at all times.

I just think it''s a violation of privacy of some sort.

And you know what?

I''m not the only one who thinks that.

Yeah, so ultimately, you know, the biggest issue was that people weren''t accepting that A, they were sending all this data up.

So ultimately, Google and Apple had to appear on Capitol Hill because they previously said, no, we''re not tracking you.

And, you know, this research demonstrated that, yes, in fact, they were tracking exactly where you are virtually at all times.

And in some cases, it begins to your consent when you turned off location services on Apple.

Again, those devices were still sending information that allowed full location of where you were because it was sending Mac addresses, which they already knew where those were.

So it''s simply one step correlation in a database they already have.

So that''s not really fair to say that they''re not grabbing that information.

And ultimately, you know, they did resolve these things.

You know, it''s funny that the same thing is still happening, right?

All these phones are still doing the same things.

The only difference is now you click OK when they say they do it.

But the benefit here is that for people who don''t want this sort of technology to run, they can say no on their phone.

The scary thing, though, is that even if you don''t even have one of these phones, it''s all the phones around that are still collecting that information of your router, of the devices on your network, even though it''s somebody else''s device.

I saw a video the other day about a guy who put like a hundred Android cell phones all in a wagon and slowly walked down the road, and this triggered the Google location API thing to make it show that the road was really congested and made it turn red as well.

So it looks like this API is still under attack just by researchers and people doing weird stunts and stuff So yeah, Sammy has a pretty cool YouTube channel.

You should check that out And he''s also given a lot of talks at various conferences like she''s all over the world How many talks have you given at this point Sammy?

I don''t know maybe 50 or so Where are you working now and after all days?

I mean this is just such a whirlwind life you''ve had so far I''ve started a company called Open Path with some friends, and we''ve been growing quite a bit.

I''ve done some research in RFID and cloning badges, and being able to demonstrate how to break into buildings.

Many years ago, we found that technology has not changed in the 10 years since I''ve looked.

You know, wrote software that was able to clone badges and break into various levels of security for physical access for buildings.

And we were sitting around and thinking, well, you know, why is this still a problem?

And it''s still inconvenient.

Like, why do I have to carry around this thick card in my wallet?

like I''m trying to get rid of my wallet.

And we ended up building this business called Open Path where you could essentially have physical access control for businesses and buildings where, hey, you don''t need a card.

You could use a card if you wanted, but you could just use your phone.

Your phone actually has really strong encryption.

We have things like TLS, we have AES, we have open encryption standards that people have been trying to break for many, many years and haven''t that are entirely open and can be inspected by anyone.

So we''re using those technologies to essentially unlock doors and you don''t even need to pull your phone out.

You literally just get within Bluetooth range of one of these devices, then you can walk right in as long as you have authorization.

So we''re trying to really make a really modern and cloud-based and secure way of getting into buildings that is just really convenient because I''m just trying to get rid of the things in my wallet and this kind of technology is just really interesting.

Yes, that technology is interesting, but so much technology is interesting.

And we live in a time where technology is in abundance all around us.

And if you think about technology as much as Sammy does, it''s like a playground for him.

To be able to tinker with it all and take it apart and put it back together in ways it was never intended, Sammy''s hacker mindset is still going strong today and it will probably be strong for decades more to come, provided he doesn''t accidentally launch another warm and take down the largest social networking website once again.

A big thank you to Sammy Camcart for coming on and telling us all this.

All right, so I was up late last night.

Late for me as a dad is like 11 p.m., but I''m sitting here at my computer and my dark basement, you know, pulling notes together.

David, what music did I have on?

You have one guess.

Oh, oh, I know exactly what you had on.

You had Trent Rezner, social network soundtrack.

It makes anything you''re doing feel, you know, twice as important and twice as revolutionary, and it just felt very apt for this episode.

Oh, man.

So I have been listening in the last 24 hours to 50 cent in the club because that came out my freshman year of college same year as the Facebook.com and like, man, 50 cent Facebook.com Can''t get any better than that.

Perfect match made in heaven.

Well, I''ll check out our wall-to-wall from the old days and see if they''re already post about that.

All right, let''s do it.

Let''s do it.

Is it you, is it you, who got the truth now?

Is it you, is it you, is it you, sit me down, say it straight, another story on the way, who got the truth.

Welcome to the Fall 2024 season of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them.

I''m Ben Gilbert.

David Rezenthal.

And we are your hosts.

Today, we are studying a company whose products are used by more humans than any other company in history, Meta.

Of course, formerly known as Facebook.

So I figured I would contextualize these numbers a little bit.

Meta has four billion monthly active users.

And daily active users are over three billion.

Yeah, nuts.

There are only eight billion humans on Earth.

So as I started to brainstorm what the closest competitors could be to serving half of the humans, I thought surely I can find it in empires or governments from the past where there is some larger percentage.

Yeah, it makes sense.

Nope.

The Roman Empire at its peak was only 40% of humans tops, you know, the data is a little hard to actually find from that period of time.

But the British Empire, which we have a little bit better handle on, at its peak was only 23% of the global human population.

So no government tech company utility, et cetera, has ever addressed so much of the world.

It''s just wild.

There''s no other way to put it.

In the over 20 years since its founding, MetaTruly has connected humanity through its apps, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and now Threads.

So today, we''re going to study how they did it.

There''s been a lot of ink spilled writing about Facebook over the years, and for its first 10 years, most of that writing focused on the many benefits to society, with breathless exuberance over milestone after milestone.

And for the past 10 years, it''s kind of seemed like medic could do nothing right.

Reporting focused on its many stumbles, the massive mistakes, the incredible controversies surrounding the company, and well, we will of course discuss these events as part of our story and analysis.

Our goal today on this podcast episode is really to understand how it is that meta became the dominant fabric that connects the human race and why they''ve been so successful at continuing to win over and over again.

No matter what you think of the company, it is undeniably one of the most important institutions in the world, and their global scale is no accident.

It is the result of careful actions from some of the most motivated and brilliant people in the world who believe in one mission, connecting as many people as possible.

And thought about this till now, but almost sort of total logically, this is like the most important episode we''ll ever do to try and understand.

It''s like it''s the biggest company that has ever existed.

It''s the biggest thing that''s ever existed.

Yeah, by these measures that we''re talking about right now.

Right.

Now, of course, the story of how we got here is nuts.

It is the perfect acquired stew like you''re saying David.

They speed ran their startup phase.

They swerved through multiple disruptive technology waves.

They battled fierce competitors.

They invented or maybe discovered one of the greatest business models ever.

And they''re now trying to pull forward the next technology generation through sheer force of will with AR VR and AI.

So finally listeners, we tackle one of the greatest corporate stories ever, Facebook, the Mark Zuckerberg production.

So listeners, we have one big announcement for you today.

It is time for our annual acquired survey.

If you have three to five minutes, please click the link in the show notes or go to acquired.fm slash survey to take it.

We''ll be raffling off a pair of shiny new meta ray bands and giving it a bunch of ACQ dad hats as well.

This is really our one big ask of you all year and it helps us immensely with making the show better to hear your suggestions and also to help our sponsors understand just how impactful the acquired audience is.

So go to acquired.fm slash survey and David and I are both eternally grateful.

After this episode discuss it in the Slack and check out ACQ2, our second show where we just had Clem DeLong, the CEO of Hugging face on, to talk about his view on how the open source AI ecosystem will play out.

And before we dive in, we want to briefly thank our presenting partner, JP Morgan Payments.

Yes.

Just like how we say, every company has a story.

Every company''s story is powered by payments, and JP Morgan Payments is part of so many companies'' journeys from seed to IPO and beyond.

So with that, this show is not investment advice.

David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only.

David, Roman Empire, what''s our starting place here?

No, man.

We got to start in 1984.

We''re never I mean, where else can you start?

I can make up, you know, of Roman Empire, classics, ascolas, whatever T-shirt saying Mark has this day of the week.

But Facebook has always started and ended with Mark Zuckerberg.

So we start in May of 1984 when Mark Elliott Zuckerberg is born as the second of four children to Karen and Ed Zuckerberg in Dobbs, Ferry, New York.

small little suburban town, suburb of New York City.

Yep.

And his mom is a psychologist and his dad is a dentist.

Is that right?

That''s right.

Ed studied dentistry at NYU.

He was always like really into math and computers though, but growing up the son of Jewish immigrants in New York City, you know, the expectation was you''re going to be a doctor or a lawyer.

So he goes to dentistry school, becomes a dentist, he meets Karen, they get married.

After Ed finishes dental school, they move up to Dobbsferry and Westchester County.

And Mark and his three sisters grow up as prototypical middle class suburban American kids in the 90s.

Life is good.

Your grandparents worked really hard to make a bunch of sacrifices for your parents.

Your parents are now professionals.

They''re also working hard to give opportunity to you and the family is kind of leveling up in America.

It''s the classic story here.

You can play sports and you can hang out with your friends and play video games.

Indeed, and for Mark and for me growing up, and maybe you too, it''s kind of amazing.

There''s no reason not to just explore your passions, and for Mark, those passions become threefold.

One, turn-based strategy video games, most particularly Sid Meier''s civilization.

Two, programming computers, and three, as you mentioned in everybody who watched our Chase Center show knows ancient Greek and Latin history, classics, the classics.

And pretty much in that order of importance, both to him personally and the future course of Facebook and Metta.

So let''s start with civilization, September, 1991.

David, I toyed with the intro to this show being, and we are your hosts.

Civilization is a video game upon which, but I decided not to write.

I mean, it''s kind of laughable, but like, no, this is really important here.

So September 1991, when Mark is seven years old, civilization or Siv, as its fans call it, comes out for PCs, and young Mark gets hooked, and for those of you who haven''t played Siv, it is a very particular type of turn-based strategy game, and is probably the foremost example of what is known as the four X genre.

That''s the number four letter X.

And four X stands for explore, expand, exploit, exterminate.

And despite that sort of nefarious sounding nature to the last one there, especially, seven four X games were kind of this radical branch of video games at the time where the action of playing and the way to win wasn''t just about killing all the enemies on screen.

It''s a lot more like a board game or like risk if you''re familiar with that.

It''s about strategy.

It''s about growing and marshalling your resources effectively.

And most importantly, there are multiple ways to win the game.

Most other games out there, you can win by defeating all the other players.

But you can also win by completing a technology development tree and reaching like the peak of technology, which is in the game, launching a spaceship to go colonize a new planet.

So that''s another way to win.

And in modern versions of the game, you can also win by diplomacy by getting elected the leader of the UN.

You can also win by dominating all the other players on either culture or religious dimensions too.

So it''s kind of like this amazing simulation of what it''s like to run one of the top 10 mega capitalization companies in the world today.

But to your point, this idea that it''s turn-based, you tried to amass resources, figure out how to deploy your resources, have multiple concurrent strategies so that you, as the role of the dice of the universe happens and things unfold before you and your- And other players make their moves?

Yep.

Right.

To be able to effectively react to it all and use your resources to win in whatever way winning means to you.

It''s kind of funny.

This is way too simplistic of an analogy and, you know, not fair to mark on any dimension, but the whole construct here sort of reminds me of the book Enders game, you know, like it''s these kids growing up playing this game and they didn''t realize all along.

It was actually the real game.

So playing save and other video games when he''s young PC games leads young Mark to want to learn how to program himself.

So when he''s 10, he has his parents take him to the local Barnes and Noble one day and begs them to buy him C++ for dummies.

And he dives into the book, learns everything in there and because like I need more, I need more.

So after that, his parents hire a local tutor to come and tutor him for an hour a week in programming and learning how to write software.

And Mark has this quote that he says later, I''d go to school and I''d go to class and come home.

And the way I''d think about it was awesome.

I have five whole hours to just sit and play on my computer and write software.

And then Friday afternoon would come along and it would be like, okay, wow, now I have two whole days to sit in write software.

This is amazing.

It really is astonishing as a 10 year old to be learning C++.

This is not basic.

This is language where you are thinking very close to the metal.

You have to be very aware of the constraints of your system, of manually managing memory.

It''s impressive for 14 or 16 year olds to be learning simplistic languages.

This is a whole different ballgame.

As it always is with Mark.

So while he''s a kid here, you know, in Dabbs Fairy, he codes up all sorts of little projects, including a family chat tool for all the networked computers in the house, and also his dad''s dentistry office is attached to the house.

So he builds this network called Zucknet, which is family chat between all the computers, very prescient here.

And then, speaking of family and friend''s chat.

In 1997, when Mark is 13 years old, AOL launches AM.

AOL instant messenger.

Oh, I remember it well.

Many, many, many hours lost to him.

And warning my friends and other dynamics of the AME system to gang up on people and to have other people gang up on me and Oh, man, punting people off aim.

Yes, having to create a new screen name and log off and log on and message someone and pretend you''re someone else.

I mean, the whole, this was middle school.

This was middle school for all of us, and this was middle school for Mark too.

The crazy thing about aim, to go on just a quick little digression here.

I had no idea until doing the research.

It was actually like a rogue skunkworks project within AOL.

Did you know this?

No. No, yeah, so it was a couple of engineers that just went off and built this almost against the wishes of management.

It was not originally intended to really be for social use or for kids at all.

It was more like the idea they had was it was going to be kind of like slack, like chat for workplaces.

Oh wow.

They ended up using it internally at AOL to communicate and that''s actually where away messages come from.

So they came up with a way messages because people would be in meetings or you know This is the days of desktops.

There''s no cell phones barely even laptops people got to lunch And they''d have to put up a message so that when their colleagues were trying to communicate with them They''re like no, no, I''m in a meeting.

No, I''m away That''s the origin of away messages That''s fascinating and it is interesting how you ended up kind of using away messages after a while even Well, you were there just to indicate status is the ultimate emo teenager thing It was like, I am expressing my whole self through this one line away message.

A hundred percent.

So, I mean, for people all of our age, marks age at the time, I mean, that completely changed our social experience when that came out.

So the other important thing about aim when it came out that I had no real conception of at all as a kid was that it was free.

So my family was an AOL family.

Like we were AOL subscribers, we had the UGOT mail, et cetera.

But you didn''t have to be a paying AOL subscriber to download and use AIM and join the network.

AIM goes on to become this total viral thing in North America.

I mean, kind of concurrent with Napster, a little bit before Napster.

It''s the first piece of consumer viral software.

And so by 2001, a couple years after launch, it has 36 million users, including, as we''ve been talking about, basically every middle and high schooler with access to a computer.

And, you know, 36 million users doesn''t sound like a lot today, but you got to remember, the internet was way smaller back then, way, way, way smaller.

Not just in terms of number of people had access, but also number of people who were to litter it in how to use it.

Totally.

It''s the early broadband era.

Is that era we''re talking about?

And you''re right.

Tens of millions of people, at least in the US, had internet access at this point in time.

Yup, and basically all of them, and certainly all the young people were on aim.

So the other important thing about aim and AOL here is it was pretty easy to hack, but like, oh man, there was just a field day that kids and teenagers had with like aim bots, punting software, wares, hacking programs.

If you were someone like me, you were just downloading this stuff off of FTP servers on the internet and installing it on your machine.

And it let you kind of be a punk and like kick people off of A and Bambarting them with messages, you could do some like teenage punk stuff.

But it also let you extend the functionality of what AOL and AIM was.

You could add graphics, you could add emojis, you could draw pictures.

Add lakes in your profile.

Yeah.

Oh, the ASCII aren''t your profile in your away message.

Totally.

And like, this becomes such an important part of teenage culture on the internet as we''re going up.

It''s like all this personalization of like, hey, I don''t want just what AOL gives me.

I want to control this.

Yes.

So for me, I was downloading and using this stuff.

You might have been writing it, although you might have been a little young.

No, I didn''t learn PHP until I was 15 or 16, so call it 2005.

Okay, so yeah, a little later.

Yep.

Mark is one of the kids that''s writing this stuff.

And I think that''s where he got his start.

He was doing Zucknet.

He was doing all these little projects.

But here''s AOL, this sort of unintentionally, infinitely hackable and extensible canvas that he can play around on.

So that''s number two for Mark, you know, passion number two, computers and programming.

And then passion number three is classics.

So Mark, when he enters high school, he''d gone to public school all through elementary and middle school in the Baron Dabbs fairy in Westchester County.

He does two years at the local public high school at Ardsley High School.

And after two years at arts league, Mark is like, well, you know, a couple things.

I''m not sure that this is the right high school for me for the rest of my high school career.

One, I think I would enjoy just being in a sort of like better school, like a higher level of competition, higher level of learning.

You know, he''s definitely at the top of the class at arts league.

Two is, you know, I''m really into Latin and classics and like I''m going to tap out on that real fast here at Artslee.

There''s got to be a place I can go where I can really study this.

And that takes us to Phillips Exeter Academy.

In New Hampshire, right?

Yes.

In New Hampshire.

And so Exeter is one of these private boarding high schools that have existed basically as long as Ivy League colleges have.

And they''re there just kind of as feeder schools into Ivy League colleges.

So Mark applies to Exeter, gets in, and the summer before he''s about to go, the school hosts an event in New York City and the city for incoming two years to meet each other, gets to know the school, get ready, etc.

And there Mark meets another kid who''s a lot like himself who also is really into computers, really into aim and everything going on there.

And Mark''s like, yeah, man, I really made the right choice.

Like everybody here is gonna be just like the two of us.

And that person is Adam Dantleau, future CTO of Facebook.

Amazing they met in high school.

Now the great irony of this story is that Mark and Adam ended up being like the only two kids who are really into computers in the class.

It was just the two of them.

They just happened to meet in New York City at the pre-school event.

Which is probably one of the last few years that that would be the case.

I''m sure if you went to this school today, it''d be 80% of the classes or 100% of the classes really into computers.

Yes, I think in large part because of Mark and Adam, it''s quite different these days.

Yep.

So the two of them, when they get to Exeter, become fast friends, they work on all sorts of computer projects together, software projects.

And by the end of their senior year, to graduate from Exeter, you have to do a senior project.

And, you know, most people do this like a mini college thesis, or they do something in the community, et cetera, et cetera.

Mark and Adam are like, now we''re going to build some software.

This is what we do.

So Mark one day is listening to music on his computer.

I think probably on Win Amp, which is however, everybody listen to MP3s that you got from Napster back in the day.

I think I listened on Sound Jam, but it''s just because I had a Mac.

Oh, yeah.

Future seeds of iTunes.

Yep.

That''s right.

It got acquired by Apple, and then eventually they, I think, built off the same code base and turned it into iTunes.

But everyone used WinAm. That was the aim of music players.

And in fact, AOL, I think, would acquire WinAm, a couple of years later.

Ah. Bring it all into the fold.

So, legend has it.

Mark is listening to a playlist in WinAm one day during his senior year, and he gets to the end of the playlist, and he''s like, why did the music stop?

I listened to so much music all the time on Wind Amp.

It should just know what I like and automatically pick the next song.

It should just be a DJ and then inspiration hits.

He calls up Adam and he''s like, I''ve got our senior project.

We are going to build an AI DJ plug-in for Wind Amp and they call this Synapse and like, they did it, these two high school kids.

They build an AI, I wasn''t called AI at the time, but like a, you know, a recommender system that looks at the data of what songs you''ve consumed on Winamp and predicts what song you''re going to like to consume next.

I mean, it''s basically Spotify today.

What year is this?

This would have been Spring of 2002.

Yeah, really days.

So they build this thing and then they release it to the internet and people start using it.

It It starts getting some adoption and a couple of companies, including Winamp, itself reach out to Mark and Adam and they''re like, hey, do you want to come work here?

Can we buy this?

Yeah.

And I think Microsoft was one of them too.

It was for like a million dollar acquisition offer or something like that wasn''t, you know, crazy.

But these are high school kids.

Right.

In 2002.

Yes.

But yeah, this is really important because they''re about to graduate.

Adam is going to go off to college at Caltech.

Mark is going to go off to college at Harvard in the fall, but Mark is not just like any student coming into Harvard.

He''s like, I can build these things and they have value and big companies are going to be willing to pay me for them.

I don''t need to be that worried about getting a job.

Right, he sort of always knew he had a great fall back plan so it kind of led him be risk on.

So Mark graduates, he goes off to Harvard.

It''s the natural choice on many fronts.

So I mean, one mark, of course, aces is SATs. I think he gets a 1600 on the SATs. There''s this great legend about, you had to take SAT2s to get into college back then.

I don''t know if you still do, but I think you had to have a minimum of three.

Mark doesn''t study or prepare for them at all.

He walks in the day of the test says, I''m gonna take all three that I''m gonna take on the same day.

He gets 800s on all of them.

College admissions was not gonna be a big deal.

and his older sister, Randy, was already there at Harvard.

So clearly, good to go to Harvard if he wants.

Yes.

And I think he wants enough.

Like, I don''t know that it''s that important to him, but he''s like, yeah, sure.

Harvard, it''s the best time to go there.

Yep.

In fact, there''s a video of that.

That''s right.

Have you seen this?

His dad sort of filming his reaction, and he''s pretty measured about it.

It''s very, yep, got into Harvard, and then kind of goes back to doing something else on his computer.

Yep.

And I think for most kids, for most people in the world, you would look at that and be like, what arrogance?

And like, it''s not like 18-year-old Mark is not arrogant, but I think it''s also, this is why all this stuff we''ve been talking about is important.

It''s just not that important to him.

You know, he likes building stuff, he likes making stuff, he knows it has value, he knows people will use it.

Whether he goes to Harvard, doesn''t go to Harvard, goes to college, doesn''t go to college.

It''s just not that big a deal to him, I don''t think.

Yeah, reading in between the lines, it seems like the thing that he was most excited about is, oh, good, a challenging environment where I will encounter other really smart people like myself who are ambitious.

Yes, I think that is totally right.

So Mark gets to Harvard in fall of 2002 and like he said, he goes to class, he does well, but he wants to meet other people and be around other smart folks.

He ends up joining the AEPI fraternity there, like my co-host here, my esteemed colleague been.

Indeed.

Also, my father, while he was in college.

I didn''t know that.

Yeah, that''s right.

That''s right.

Hey, you pipe.

Adam, meanwhile, of course, goes off to Caltech, you know, 3,000 miles away in the opposite corner of the country.

Also, can I just say how crazy is it that Adam DeAngelo would become Facebook''s first CTO?

They don''t go to college together.

Right.

Well, I was going to get into this in a second.

Adam has a very different experience to Caltech.

He ends up graduating from Caltech.

I think they probably do not have the same generous leave policy there that Harvard does because Harvard is weird, right?

It''s like you can leave and if you ever want to come back, you just it''s like you never left.

Oh, we''re going to come back to that in one sec.

Put a bit in that.

But for Adam at Caltech, he still finds time while he''s there to keep working on these projects.

So during his freshman year, he builds something called Buddy Zoo, you know, kind of building on synapse and the success that they had in their senior project.

Buddy Zoo takes your buddy list from AM, from AOL, and effectively turns it into a social network.

So you upload your entire buddy list to Buddy Zoo, and then you get your friends to do so too.

Buddy Zoo then analyzes and gives you a list of who are the friends of your friends, how many degrees of separation do you have to them?

And it automatically identifies clicks of like, oh, who of your friends are part of these clicks and who are their friends.

It measures popularity among users.

This is starting to sound pretty familiar here.

And this is pretty advanced stuff for 2002, 2003.

Very advanced stuff, especially for a side project for a very busy Cal Tech student.

Yep.

So, buddy, Zoo, pretty quickly in the months after Adam launches it, gets a couple hundred thousand users.

There''s gravity to this thing.

It''s becoming fairly big, especially given how small the internet was at the time.

Yeah.

And Adam is like, whoa, okay, this is interesting.

So this is kind of what scale looks like.

Synapse was cool and we had a bunch of people downloading it, but this feels like something more on the order of aim itself.

Like this is really interesting.

And the important thing with Synapse was, it was a single user application.

So it could analyze my songs and tell me what to listen to.

This is the first time Adam Mark, particularly Adam in this case, is discovering a very different type of application that gets better as more people join it.

Yes.

Now we say Adam and Adam definitely built and launched it, but it''s not like Mark wasn''t involved.

They''re staying in touch the whole time and collaborating and working through coding challenges together on what else on aim.

It''s kind of serving its original use case like they''re collaborating through it across the country.

So that summer, 2003, after their freshman year, Adam comes to Boston and gets an internship at the MIT Media Lab.

He discovers this thing called Friendster, another social network out there.

And Adam is like, whoa, this is a dedicated standalone own kind of version of what I just built with Buddy Sue.

This is like really interesting.

And it''s all on the web.

Now, Friendster was based out here in Silicon Valley, had raised money from Kleiner Perkins and Benchmark, right?

Oh, Benchmark too.

I didn''t know that.

Yep.

Which is what tied their hands and why they could not pursue an investment in Facebook.

That''s funny.

Not that I think that was a real possibility anyway, because things were kind of moving so fast, but you never hear them in any of the discussion about who was pursuing Facebook and who was iced out.

They just, they had a competitive investment.

That''s right.

That''s funny.

I never even think about that, because obviously Matt Kohler would go on to become a person-of-board partner at benchmark.

And of course, Matt was an early executive at Facebook.

Yes, exactly.

Interesting.

So here''s Friendster, this example of a real standalone company, social network, growing virally, funded by venture capitalists, based in the San Francisco Bay area, Adams was like, oh, maybe that''s sort of what we should be focusing on.

And by the end of the summer in 2003, Forenster had over 3 million users.

So really interesting, growing really quickly.

Friendster had real scale and grew really fast.

That is something that has kind of been lost to history.

Friendster is like the butt of a lot of jokes, but it exploded out of the gates.

True.

So Adam''s playing around with Friendster.

And Friendster had this feature called testimonials, which was kind of like a Facebook wall.

But in the long run, one of the core problems with Friendster was it positioned itself as a social network and about friends.

But really, it was kind of intended to be a dating site underneath at all.

Absolutely.

That was wink, wink, not a dating site.

It was this idea that like, well, there''s all these other things that are dedicated to dating, so there''s this weird stink about it.

But if you just naturally meet a friend of a friend online through a thing that''s totally not a dating site, then great.

There''s no stigma around it.

Yep.

So, specifically, when it comes to testimonials, the purpose of testimonials was supposed to be like, why you should date somebody or why they would be a great partner, which is funny.

So Adam while he''s playing around with this and he''s telling Mark about it, he actually posts on Mark''s friendster profile a testimonial and he says that, quote, Mark gets way too lucky and he posted this in the summer of 2003 and Adam was telling me the story and he Because on the one hand, it was like a stupid throwaway, you know, double entendre that I put on there because it was a, you know, a dating site.

On the other hand, it is both absolutely true about Mark that he always gets way too lucky and Facebook and meta always gets way too lucky, but it''s not luck, yeah.

It''s actually, Mark, there''s something very different about the way he operates.

It''s, and all the reasons that meta and Facebook get lucky over the years, Mark was always that way.

And it''s always because of Mark.

Mark is unbelievably good at positioning himself for a luck to do its thing.

And specifically at this point in time, what I''m talked about is like, he was always looking around.

He was looking at Friendster.

He was looking at what we did with Synapse.

He was looking at what I did with Buddy Zoo.

He was looking about the projects at Harvard he did that we''re about to talk about.

And he was always thinking, like, how do I incorporate all of this and make whatever I''m doing better?

This was the stew that Facebook is about to come out of.

So this brings us to fall semester 2003-2004, Mark sophomore year, and the famous Kirkland House suite H-33 with Mark Zuckerberg, Chris Hughes, Dustin Moskowitz, and Billy Olson as the four roommates there.

Three of the four of those names are names you may know as the founders of Facebook.

Yes.

So Mark is focused heading into his sophomore year at Harvard.

And he''s not focused on classes.

He''s focused on projects.

And he''s done like 10.

I mean, this is something that, again, is kind of lost to history.

People talk about, oh, there''s the one face-mash thing that he did that led to Facebook.

He did like 10 side projects.

I mean, I remember being in this era of my life where you feel like you have superpowers as a programmer, and you''re looking around, and you''re like, oh, I can make a website for that.

I can make a website for that.

I had the same thing where the world wasn''t saturated with apps yet.

And so you could just like make things that made your life better, or other people''s lives better, or a cool way to connect people.

And I distinctly remember feeling like, how come nobody else realizes you can just do this?

I know what that sort of feels like, and I know that mentality he was in.

There were 10 things that he had worked on, even before face smash.

Yep.

So the first of which, right as they''re getting back to campus that fall, is Mark builds a tool called course match.

Oh, yeah.

That''s right.

And this is as students are shopping for classes for fall semester.

You can upload which classes you''re thinking of taking or which classes you''ve signed up for.

And you can see who of your friends have also signed up for that class or planning to sign up for that class.

This is just text.

All this is, is a list of classes and a list of people who sign up, and it takes Harvard by storm.

I mean, think about it, right?

Like it''s obvious in hindsight, a bunch of college undergraduates, yeah, you want to take classes you''re interested, but like, really you want to make sure you take the classes with the people that you want to be around.

I was literally texting my friend yesterday who was at Harvard at this time, and she said, oh yeah, people totally chose their classes based on who was in them.

Of course.

Of course.

So Mark sees this and he''s kind of like, you know, again, it''s one of these learnings, an observation about the world.

He''s like, wow, people are spending a lot of time on this tool.

It''s literally just lists of people.

You click on a class name and people would spend a lot of time just combing over that list of people.

Totally.

There''s nothing visually compelling here.

So he''s like, well, okay, now it''s time for my next project.

You know, people have registered for classes.

What if there was something visually compelling for people to spend time on.

What if I overstepped a little bit and, uh, yeah.

And this is face mash well chronicled in all the many books stories.

The Stephen Levy book, the David Kirkpatrick book, movies, you know, whatever movies movie movie.

Mark codes this up in one evening in his dorm in Kirkland House, and it''s basically the website hot or not for Harvard with a couple of like actually interesting mechanical twists on it.

Now, the two big problems with it are, one, this is probably just not a good idea or not like kind.

Generally, it is a head-to-head voting mechanic on which picture is, quote, unquote, hotter than the other picture.

The other thing that is really not great is rather than having users upload their own pictures, mark hacks into the Kirkland House, servers and downloads the Facebook photos of all the students to populate the website.

Lowercaseface, space, lowercasebook.

Yes.

So we should probably spend a minute and talk about what a Facebook was before Facebook.

So my big question for you is, did Ohio State have a Facebook?

It did not.

It probably would have been like a telephone book sized thing if they did.

I mean, I went to college in the fall of 2007 and so you could look up people''s email addresses.

If you had their first and last name, you might be able to get some other, maybe major, but it was a text blob.

It wasn''t a photo.

Well, I think most, if not all Ivy League schools back in the day had these Princeton where I went, certainly had these when I showed up on campus.

In fact, Phillips Exeter had one, the private high schools did too.

That''s right.

that''s right.

So you had to give the university or in Exeter''s case, the high school, a school photo of you when you were coming in before you matriculated.

And then they would literally make a book, like a printed book with the names and class years and photos of all the incoming students from the freshman class.

And I think if I remember right at Princeton at least, they would republish the book every year for your class because some people would leave, some people would join, et cetera, et cetera.

All right, so these are photos stored digitally that Mark then, while plugged into the campus network from his dorm room, is accessing downloading and then putting up on his own website that he is hosting.

Yes, called FaceMash.

Now, a couple of interesting things about FaceMash.

One, gosh, if Mark was blown away by the engagement of the Harvard population with CourseMatch, face-mash takes that to such a whole nother level that it actually melts down the servers in Kirkland House.

And the IT department at Harvard has to shut off internet within hours of it going live to all of Kirkland House, less this like continue to spread virally within Harvard and take down like all of the servers.

Oh, so maybe he didn''t actually re-host the images.

' would republish the book every year for your class because some people would leave, some people would join, et cetera, et cetera.

All right, so these are photos stored digitally that Mark then, while plugged into the campus network from his dorm room, is accessing downloading and then putting up on his own website that he is hosting.

Yes, called FaceMash.

Now, a couple of interesting things about FaceMash.

One, gosh, if Mark was blown away by the engagement of the Harvard population with CourseMatch, face-mash takes that to such a whole nother level that it actually melts down the servers in Kirkland House.

And the IT department at Harvard has to shut off internet within hours of it going live to all of Kirkland House, less this like continue to spread virally within Harvard and take down like all of the servers.

Oh, so maybe he didn''t actually re-host the images.

Maybe he was just pointing at the URLs that were hosted by Kirkland House.

Oh, I didn''t think about that.

Yeah, that might have been how it worked.

But either way, dude knows how to make something that gets engagement.

Yes, yes, he does.

So the other interesting thing from Mark''s perspective about FaceMash is that it was the first time he was building a rich web app as one of these projects.

He had fully built on the Lampstack, and he had probably used the Lampstack Linux Apache MySQL PHP for course match.

And so to be clear, that''s an operating system, a web server, with Apache MySQL, the free open source database, PHP, the free open source programming language.

Yes.

But this is the first time that he''s building like a real rich consumer grade web app on top of the lamp stack.

Rich consumer grade.

It''s the technical requirements of course match, but with photos.

Photos in voting.

Sure.

Yeah, you have like probably an additional table of information in the database or something, but the big takeaway here is, A, of course, the use case shouldn''t have done it.

B, wow, it''s engagement.

C, this is training wheels of how to use these new open source web technologies.

If you go back two, three, four years, you''re going to have to go to Oracle, you''re going to have to go to Microsoft, you''re going to have to buy enterprise grade, super proprietary systems to do this.

And this is all just like free and something you could cobble together and upload onto some Linux web hosting and boom, there had to be a hundred times more, a thousand times more web applications created by the Mark Zuckerbergs everywhere in this period of time doing whatever random little project that they thought would be fun or funny or useful.

Yeah, it''s such a perfect example, despite its problematic nature of this is like the first time in history where you need neither money nor permission to launch an application like this on the internet.

Totally.

$10 domain, $100 a year web hosting that includes the database, no licenses required, PHP is all free.

Maybe the bandwidth would have been an issue, but this is on the order of $100 to do this.

Yeah.

Well, clearly the bandwidth wasn''t an issue because they shut down the internet to Kirkland House.

So David, this feels like a thing you should get kicked out of school for doing.

Yeah.

Harvard, as you imagine, is not pleased about this.

They hallmark in front of the administrative board, which is a disciplinary committee for students when things like this happen.

He and his fraternity brothers are pretty sure that he''s actually going to get thrown out of school for this.

So the night before the ad board meets to make their final decision, AEPI, the fraternity throws a good-by-mark party that night.

And legend has it that this is where Mark and Priscilla Chan meet for the first time in Priscilla, of course, is now Mark''s wife.

Yep.

So the abort meets the next day and decides not to throw Mark out of school but to put him on disciplinary probation for the rest of the year.

Basically, don''t do this again.

Slap on the wrist.

Slap on the wrist.

So Mark doesn''t end up getting kicked out of Harvard.

But he does kind of end up becoming like the Harvard computer celebrity, even before Facebook.

Right.

I mean, this is a big deal.

Everyone on campus knew about face mash.

A lot of people already knew about course match anyway.

So he''s now the guy who can make websites and web applications here at Harvard that people use.

Yeah, and it just so happens that there is a group of upperclassmen at Harvard led by two twins, the Winklevoss twins, who have an idea to digitize Harvard''s Facebook and build an online version of it that they''re thinking of calling the Harvard connection, then they think maybe we could actually take that to other schools too and call it connect you as sort of the broader version.

This was not at all a unique idea, not at all.

Lots of people at lots of schools had this exact same idea.

In fact, Harvard word itself had this idea.

The IT department at Harvard had been promising for years and talking about how they were going to build a digital version of the Harvard Facebook.

And friendsters out there.

And I looked it up.

Stanford had club nexus, Columbia had C U community, Yale had Yale station.

I''m sorry, there''s a whole movie made about the drama of how novel this idea is.

It''s not totally not.

I''m pretty sure Princeton had one too when When I was there, pre-facebook, yeah, totally not a novel idea, lots of people have it.

The Winklevast twins though, you know, Mark is now this celebrity on campus, they need somebody to be a programmer to write the site.

So they talk to Mark and Mark agrees that he''s going to help them out and help code this site that they''re thinking about.

Also, again, the Chutzpah to say, we have this idea, you are a programmer, you will program our idea.

Clearly, Mark can come up with his own ideas that get people excited enough to use the stuff he builds.

Now, so far, it''s been a little unsavory, but he doesn''t have a problem coming up with ideas with product market fit and executing them end to end.

The only thing he hasn''t done so far is made money, made anything as a business.

But what other pieces of the puzzle does he really need from some people with an idea?

None.

It''s funny.

I was going to save this for a little later, but let''s talk about it now.

Now, in addition to technically because of open source and the lamp stack, and also socially because of AIM and everything going on, the world sort of for the first time something like Facebook being able to be built for no money and no permission.

Also this was the first time that a technical person, because of this, could just do everything.

Like Mark didn''t need anybody.

Mark didn''t need a non-technical co-founder.

Mark didn''t need a CEO.

He was the CEO.

I remember thinking the same thing when I shipped my first app to the App Store, co-founder Ian and I in 2009, I think made something called Seas the Day, got over a million downloads, two programmers uploaded some of the App Store at a slightly different era because that''s mobile not web, but I remember looking around being like, whoa, we like didn''t need a business guy.

Right.

That''s the craziest thing.

You can make stuff and you can put it in the world.

totally.

So this takes us to Harvard''s Christmas break.

Now at the time, Harvard did final exams for the fall semester after Christmas break in January.

So the idea is all the students go home for Christmas break.

You come back in January and then there''s a week of reading period where you re-familiarize yourself with all the material from your classes, then you take final exams, then there''s a little break.

There''s a course shopping period for spring semester and spring weeks to program a new idea.

Exactly.

To not study in program a new idea.

And during Christmas break, he had actually come out to Silicon Valley, to the Bay Area, to hang out with some friends out here, and seeing, you know, the physical embodiment of all these great tech companies, Yahoo, early Google, et cetera, drove by them all.

And so he comes back and he''s like extra, extra motivated.

He''s like, you know, this digital Facebook idea, I think this is something that a lot of people want.

I bet I can code this up in a week and just launch it.

And again, not a business, just like a project.

He has this gut feeling that people will use this if he makes it.

Totally.

Now importantly though, all the stuff he''d been doing throughout the year, he''s like, well, I can incorporate that into this project too.

It''d be pretty boring if it''s just a digital Facebook.

Like, I don''t think people want that, but I''ve made all this other stuff that people really, really like and engage with.

And when you say just a digital Facebook, you mean like essentially the profile page would just be a photo in a name.

Right, just like the physical version of like, here is a list of all the students in the class and here is their, you know, stock profile picture.

Yep.

So later, after thefacebook.com blew up, Mark told the Harvard Crimson in an interview, you.

I don''t really know what the next big thing is because I don''t spend my time making big things.

I spend time making small things and then when the time comes I put them together.

That''s the kind of stuff I do.

Small little projects and eventually they all fit together.

And that''s what the Facebook.com ends up being.

So Mark gets back from reading period.

Instead of studying he dives in.

He I am his friend Andrew McCullum who he knows from CS classes and asks Andrew to do the page design.

Andrew says, yeah, sure thing, I''ll help you out.

Andrew goes and fires up Photoshop.

He finds an image on the internet of some guy who looks kind of cool and puts it in the header of the design for the site.

Behind a cloud of ones and zeros because it''s cool.

It''s like the matrix.

Yes.

It''s gradiented.

You know, it''s sort of white on the left, blue on the right.

And for like, you know, a year or two, However, along the Facebook guy was it the header, everybody''s like, who is the Facebook guy?

People think it''s Al Pacino, people think it''s a student.

Do you know who the Facebook guy was?

I totally do.

I look this up.

I smell like two hours trying to figure this out, really?

Yeah, it''s amazing.

Because everyone always said it''s Al Pacino and I''m like, it doesn''t really, no.

Al Pacino must have looked really different when he was younger.

And it''s not.

All right.

Tell me your answer.

I''ll tell you if it matches mine.

All right.

So there was an 80s song that got really big called centerfold.

Oh, yes.

This is it.

And the images of Peter Wolf.

Yep.

Who is the lead singer of the J.

Giles band?

We''ll link to that image.

There''s a great Kora post, which we should say, Adam D''Angelo, founder and CEO of Kora after Facebook.

There''s a great Kora post about this where there''s unmistakably the photo of Peter Wolf that Facebook guy is based on.

They just sort of pixelated it and made it duotone instead of the original photograph.

So great.

So great.

So on the evening of February 4th, 2004, after final exams, right when students are coming back, getting into the mode for the new semester, starting to shop for spring semester courses.

Mark Zuckerberg launches the Facebook.com and right off the bat from the moment somebody logs in, the functionality is like awesome.

So the registration page reads, you can use the Facebook to search for people at your school, find out who are in your classes, course match, look up your friends friends, buddy zoo, see a visualization of your entire social network, buddy zoo plus graphics.

And then at the bottom of every page is the famous copyright 2004 the Facebook on Mark Zuckerberg production.

Awesome.

I feel like it''s like one of the most infamous screenshots is the screenshot of that original homepage.

So so great.

So importantly, things that did not exist here yet, messages, wall posts, even I don''t think pokes were in the original very first version.

That''s a good question.

If they weren''t in the very first version, they launched pretty quickly thereafter.

But no Facebook events, no photos other than your profile photo, I mean, no, I don''t even think status updates were in the very first one.

I don''t think status updates were there yet, no.

But all the lessons from all the other projects, all the elements of them are coming together here.

So, once again, registration is limited to email addresses on the Harvard.edu domain.

That was part of the magic of what had made all the other projects so successful is like, it''s not randos in here.

It''s other people at Harvard, it''s your classmates, it''s the people you care most about.

Yep.

And by the nature of that, it''s the real identities.

And that''s what makes it different than all these other social networks.

MySpace existed, Friendster existed, but anyone could sign up for these.

And in part, that meant that they had more explosive growth because there was no governor on the growth.

And we''ll talk about all the problems that sort of come from anyone anywhere I can sign up at any time.

But the very core thing here is authenticated people.

The people who are signing up for Facebook at the start are people you know go to the same college as you and have to use their real name matched against a university issue to email address.

Identity and authentic identity is a part of the company from its first moment.

Coupled with super important learning number two from face mash, it''s all user-submitted content.

So no pre-population with anything from Harvard, you know, no scraping from Harvard servers, etc.

And like, yeah, on the one hand, that prevents Mark from getting into trouble.

On the other hand, though, it sets the expectation and the requirement and trains the behaviors of the users of you got to enter all the content into this site yourself.

You put in your Amescreen name, you put in your cell phone, you put in your interests, you put in your classes.

is.

Also, isn''t it crazy that they displayed cell phone numbers for the longest time?

Right.

Well, again, think about the functionality and the utility to the users.

On the one hand, you would never disclose your cell phone number to the general public.

On the other hand, other students and your friends at Harvard knowing your cell phone number, well, that''s actually pretty useful for getting in touch, for going out, for going to parties, for planning things, etc.

etc.

These are all people you would give your email and phone number and maybe even birthday too if they just asked.

Totally.

You would probably also give them your relationship status, which is in there.

Formalizing your relationship status for the first time here on the facebook.com.

You can add a photo of your own choosing as your profile picture.

So big difference from old school Facebook''s where it''s whatever the university chooses or it''s a stock school photo or whatever, like, no, you get to express your personality.

You get to Photoshop it as much as you want.

And you can update it whenever you want.

And you can update it whenever you want.

So it is amazing how much of the next billion plus people''s source of value comes from this founding moment.

The Facebook grows tremendously in functionality over time, but everything is like a natural outcropping out of authentic identity, user-submitted content, trust that the people who are seeing this content are people in your sort of private network.

The whole thing is here in this first few weeks of coding that got done and then threw up the landing page.

I would even go one step further than that.

The actual nature of the seeding of the network here is maybe the most important thing.

And here''s what I mean by that.

Once Mark launches this, it takes off like wildfire within Harvard.

Of course, he''s already a celebrity, already known for launching these projects.

People are tuned in, waiting for the next Mark Zuckerberg production.

Within the first 24 hours, 650 people join.

There''s only 2,000 people in a class at Harvard.

So I think there''s about seven or 8,000 undergraduates total.

within two weeks, over half of the entire undergraduate population is active on Facebook.

So now, here''s what I mean and why this seeding is so important.

This initial network is super dense, super engaged and super active.

That not only sets the norms for how you''re going to behave on Facebook going forward, It also means that as the network grows virally, it radiates out from this like nuclear reactor of a base.

Contrast that with an approach of something like Forenster that''s default open to everybody backed by Silicon Valley venture dollars trying to grow.

They''re doing marketing, okay, let''s say somebody in Ohio hears about Forenster somehow maybe they see an ad for it.

they sign up.

When they join the service, there''s no friends there.

There''s nothing to do.

Right.

There''s no functionality.

It''s not alive.

When you join the Facebook, even though it''s limited to just Harvard students, you sign up and you''re like blown away by how alive this site is.

Right.

Almost nobody can use the Facebook, but for the people who can, it''s an unbelievably great experience.

As they expanded, that stayed true.

It was either you''re not allowed to use it, or if you are, it''s blown away great instantly.

That''s basically always true.

And the moments when Facebook stops growing is when that''s not true.

And then they sort of refocus on it, and then that gets the growth back.

Here''s another thing that I think was really important about this seating of Facebook was actually that it happened at Harvard.

Harvard is the top global brand among universities.

Whatever you personally think about Harvard, it''s undeniable, especially back then, that it was like the top.

If you were a kid or a family pretty much anywhere in the world, you knew what Harvard was.

This was really important as Facebook expanded because it had this patina to it.

It was like elite, especially as they grew.

There were clones.

There were lots of other Facebook copies out there.

And even if they were as good as what Mark had built, they didn''t start at Harvard.

It''s kind of like civilization.

Nobody else could ever invade Facebook''s turf, but they could invade other people''s turf.

So somebody put it to me in the research.

There was a fairly big competitor in Germany.

I think maybe called study vice or something like that.

yeah, Facebook could really easily go into Germany and people in Germany would be like, oh, Facebook, I''ve heard of that.

This is interesting.

Study Vice could never go into Boston like ever.

Hmm.

Interesting.

Now that''s a great point.

Okay.

So like weeks go by and they''ve saturated Harvard.

And not only that, you start seeing this thing happen, which just to the level with listeners.

This stayed true for several years.

This is a crazy stat.

70% of people who ever signed up were active that day.

There are not user engagement retention metrics better than that in the world.

The fact that as they grew, it didn''t matter how many more people they added, it was still the case that 70% of users ever were daily active.

And so you have this crazy situation at Harvard, where it''s just like, to your point, nuclear reactor levels engaging.

In fact, this term wouldn''t get coined till later in the summer, but this is from the Facebook effect, David Kirkpatrick''s book.

They had coined a term for how students seem to use a site.

Zuckerberg, Moskowitz, and Parker, who will talk about who comes in, called it the trance.

Once you start combing through the Facebook, it was very easy to keep going.

It was hypnotic.

you just keep clicking and clicking and clicking from profile to profile viewing the data.

And every single one of those clicks is a page view.

So yeah, this hits Harvard like an earthquake.

It''s face-mash all over again except a good problem, not a bad problem.

It''s all legit.

The servers are melting down.

Even Mark is blown away by how big this thing gets so quickly.

Yeah.

Right away they add the wall.

So there''s a way to publicly post things like testimonials on your friends'' walls.

You could view a wall the wall so you could see that public posts that you were making back and forth to each other so that you''ve got your profile information, wall posts, and that''s it.

Yeah.

But to your point, very quickly, Mark is adding features, adding functionality, adding things to do to the site.

The other thing that he does right off the bat is say, okay, we''re taking this to other colleges too.

So he recruits his roommates.

Dustin Moskovitz comes on to help maintain the site.

Dustin was actually an econ major.

He had no idea how to code.

He goes out and buys Pearl for dummies.

And Mark''s like, that''s great that you read that.

The site is written in PHP.

So Dustin goes and learns PHP too, and helps with coding the site and keeping up with everything.

You know, Pearl, you can learn PHP.

It''s much easier.

Chris Hughes joins too, Angie McCollum joins, and then they need to keep buying servers to keep up with the traffic or else everything is going to melt down.

So, one of Mark''s fraternity brothers in A.

Pies, a guy named Eduardo Saverin, and Eduardo was, I think, part of the business and investing club at Harvard.

So, they recruited Eduardo in and Eduardo invests $1,000 in infrastructure for the site.

Mark invests another $1,000, so together there''s $2,000 of investment in the Facebook.com.

The deal they strike is that Mark gets two-thirds of the company, and Eduardo gets one-third of the company, and Eduardo sets up a business entity to formalize all of this as a Florida LLC.

Eduardo was from Florida.

Right away, as we were saying, Mark''s like, great, this is not just a Harvard thing.

We need to bring it to other colleges.

And he specifically chooses Colombia because, Ben, as you said, there was an existing competitor there.

And he''s like, I want to see how Facebook competes.

And like, I want to know right away, can we displace it?

It''s so interesting.

He doesn''t go to the schools where there''s nothing.

He goes to the schools where there is something and wants to be better than it.

Which is so counterintuitive to how most people would think they say, like, oh no, this is a race.

I''m going to go to the white space.

I''m going to gobble everything up and then wait to take on competitors when I''m bigger and stronger like Mike''s like, nope, right away.

This is a early mindset of we are going to be globally dominant.

If you''re okay splitting the market, you go for the white space and then you say, let''s see how much of the low-hanging fruit we can easily get.

But if you''re Facebook, you''re going to say, let''s go to the hardest possible competitor, extinguish them and then we will have a better shot at owning the whole market and we can get to the low-hanging fruit later.

By the way, their strategy once they did win at a school like Columbia was to go figure out all the schools that were like closest to Columbia in terms of network connections and then win there too to kind of like build a moat around their victory.

Yep.

So there we have the initial crew, Mark, Dustin, Chris, Andrew, and Eduardo, the five co-founders of Facebook.

book.

The other interesting thing about going to Columbia, which they do three weeks after the launch at Harvard, 22 days, it was the same month all within February 2004.

They set up Columbia as a completely different network than Harvard.

So if you join the Columbia Facebook, you can''t then go access all the profiles of Harvard students.

right?

At first there was zero connectivity between the two, which is another sort of counterintuitive thing.

You''d think like, oh, great.

I want to build this as big as possible.

Mark clearly wants to conquer all these other schools.

The best way to do that is to have all this alive content come right to them from Harvard.

I think he realized that had he done that, it would have socially inhibited sharing within Harvard.

Yeah.

The scarce commodity is trust.

That is the important lesson here.

It''s also a very convenient infrastructure decision where if these two systems truly don''t need to talk to each other, that''s great.

Put different servers in different data centers.

Don''t worry about overloading the database.

Don''t worry about number of rights per second and reads per second.

It''s great.

If every school gets its own server rack, you''d end up not having some of these issues that the other social networks have.

Friendsters out there trying to compute second-degree friends of friends, which is this crazy hard computer science problem, especially as the global number of people growing.

It''s an n-squared problem, and Facebook is over here, or the Facebook at the time, in the land where they''re keeping n small.

So even anything that''s n-squared is contained within that school, and their servers aren''t falling over and taking 20 plus seconds to load pages the way that the friendsters of the world are.

This is such an interesting point because technology infrastructure advantage has always been a core part of Facebook even back to this very beginning.

What''s interesting is that it flips at some point.

As Facebook grows and eventually becomes open to everybody, their competitive advantage becomes their tech is so good and their infrastructure is so good that they can do everything you we were just talking about that friends that couldn''t do and that my space couldn''t do.

But in these early days, their competitive advantage is actually like, no, we''re scale out, not scale up.

And then Mark was totally willing to just flip the bit later.

Right, it''s effectively counter positioning.

They''re building the Facebook in such a way that the use cases don''t require incredibly sophisticated technology to accomplish those feature sets.

There''s this funny chicken of the egg thing here, and I think the answer like many chicken of the egg is both.

Mark at the moment he conceives of an idea, thinks through the technical requirements and the user experience, and they''re sort of co-mingled in the product development process.

And so I really do think even at age 19, he was sort of aware of the scaling benefits in addition to the user experience benefits of launching in this way.

Totally agree.

Okay, fun bit of trivia about Harvard''s leave policy that we referenced earlier.

Do you know what else Mark does on the same evening that they launched Columbia?

No idea.

He goes to hear Bill Gates speak on campus.

That was the same night.

The same night during which speech Bill mentions that he actually felt comfortable dropping out of Harvard because he discovered that Harvard had this really generous leave policy that you could take an infinite leave of absence and pursue something else and come back anytime you want.

And Mark would actually say later that Bill saying that at the event was part of what got him comfortable doing the same thing.

Unbelievable.

It is crazy tying this back to our Microsoft episode.

This would have been what early 2004.

And so this would have been right after Bill stopped being CEO, handed the CEO reins to Steve.

He was still the chief architect and still chairman of the board, but it''s sort of this like post DOJ time for Microsoft where Bill is just technically focused and can do things like go speak at Harvard.

Yeah, it is amazing how much influence Microsoft had on Facebook and on Mark.

We have a lot more to talk about on that front.

So next couple days after Columbia launches, Facebook launches at Stanford at Yale, by the end of the semester, they''re in over 100 schools in like, you know, what, three, four months.

Like the speed they''re moving with is crazy.

And they start building these wait lists.

I mean, this is the other, there''s so many common startup things that Facebook kind of invented.

they built tremendous demand before they would light up the network.

They knew that as soon as you''re in Facebook, you want to quickly get to seven friends, or 10 friends, or whatever the metric is to create that magic moment where you''re like, oh, yeah, Facebook now works for me.

So they wanted to wait until they had sufficient demand to boom open that school.

And then once it''s open, everybody should have the best possible experience.

And so you''re seeing Facebook basically say, okay, wherever there''s really strong demand that''s where we''ll open next and we''re not going to open anywhere where we see like, you know, middleing demand for our product.

Yep, totally.

Meanwhile, here we are at the end of the school year.

The Winkelvast twins take the whole connect you situation to Harvard''s president Larry Summers to adjudicate this dispute between them and Mark.

Larry says, Hey, Harvard is not going to get involved here.

This is a business dispute between students, eventually the two twins Sue, Mark, and Facebook, they set all for $65 million, $45 million of which is paid in pre-IPO.

Facebook stock, obviously that grows a large portion of that.

Then I think they sell and put into Bitcoin in like 2011, 2012 time frame.

So they end up pretty fine out of all this.

They did great.

They did great.

But here we are at the end of the school year.

Summer comes around and Andrew McCollum has some connections out in the Bay Area.

He had interned at electronic arts.

Adam D''Angelo is going to be spending the summer from Caltech.

So the crew all decides like, hey, great, let''s not get internships.

Let''s go rent a house out in Palo Alto, move to Silicon Valley and work on Facebook there for the summer and see what happens.

And yes, the house did indeed have a pool.

Yes, they did indeed install a zip line off the chimney.

That was not fiction in the movie that did actually happen.

And it is important to know, to this point, it is a project.

Mark and Dustin and Chris and everyone who moves out, they are there to work on a project that they think is cool and seems to be working and get exposure to Silicon Valley and venture capitalists for when they start their start-up having a network.

That is literally the mentality.

Facebook is live at how many schools, David?

A hundred.

A hundred schools.

And they are going out not with the intent to make this a company but to contemplate what company they could start and meet people that can help them with that.

Yeah.

Now when we say crew who moves out, that crew did not include Eduardo.

So Eduardo had an internship in New York and decided that he was not going to move out for the summer.

Yeah.

Tough decision.

Not a great decision.

On the other hand, he ends up with 2% of Facebook, so he''s also fun.

Yeah.

So to make a long story short, yes, everything you saw in the social network around this, the result is effectively correct.

That Eduardo Saverin goes from owning a third of this Florida based LLC to something like two percent of this C-Corp that is a Delaware C-Corp based in California that goes on to become or is Facebook Inc.

And the justification that they effectively use in changing this structure is, hey, a bunch of us moved California to start a company together.

You stayed back and yes, you sold some ads in the meantime, but like you didn''t come start the company with us.

Listener, we leave it to you to sort of decide how that should have played out and what''s fair.

none of us were there.

He was a co-founder of Facebook and then ended up with 2% and lived on a different coast.

Okay, so they''re in California.

They get really serious about the Facebook.

They actually are still working on something else called Wirehog concurrently within the same team, but they''re starting to realize, okay, this is the Facebook thing really, really has legs.

And as they''re sort of contemplating their next move, they literally run into someone on the street who will change everything.

David, who is this person?

That person is the co-founder of Napster, Sean Parker, who would have a brief but very, very large impact on the company.

Yes.

So before we tell the Sean Parker chapter of the Facebook, now is a great time to talk about our presenting partner, JP Morgan Payments.

In these critical moments, like we were talking about now, where a new paradigm or technology shift happens, David and I typically focus on the founders and the innovators who figure out how to build something really great, but unfortunately it''s not just the good actors who take advantage of these opportunities.

Oh yeah, there are always bad actors on the other side of the same new technology, and this is especially true whenever money or value is exchanged, whether it be phone scammers taking advantage of international networks in the 80s and 90s, viruses spreading through or the early internet, or today''s cybercrime, like AI-powered identity theft, as technology gets smarter so will the fraud tactics.

Enter JP Morgan payments.

With the digital payments ecosystem expanding rapidly through innovations like real-time payments, blockchain, and peer-to-peer networks, the attack surface has grown exponentially.

For a company like JP Morgan, who moves $10 trillion a day across 160 countries, staying ahead of bad actors is critical for the entire global financial system.

That''s why they''ve been investing in technology like AI and cyber fraud prevention for years.

Their AI models have been trained on billions of transactions that is unparalleled scale and expertise when it comes to fraud intelligence.

And it''s only getting smarter and more reliable given their processing over 5,000 transactions per second with 99.9% accuracy.

Regardless of your size or industry, you can leverage their enterprise grade solutions like validation services, which validates bank accounts, individuals, and businesses.

One great example is a Fortune 500 global media company.

They needed an automated solution for the thousands of influencers on their platform to do rapid onboarding, minimize errors, and ensure consistent validation of bank account information.

They were able to compress validation times from days to minutes so they could scale.

They''ve got a great payments developer portal.

It''s a trusted, scalable platform built with payment security and risk management in mind.

developers can even integrate their preventative fraud solutions to act before an incident takes place.

Sardine, a leader in financial crime prevention, collaborates with JPMorgan payments and embeds its account validation services API to analyze and protect over two billion devices for 300 companies with AI to the highest standards of fraud and compliance safety.

David, I actually met the founder of Sardine at the meetup that we did after the Chase Center event with JPMorgan payments in San Francisco last month.

That''s right.

It was awesome.

Ultimately, every business benefits from built-in fraud prevention, whether you''re moving $100 or $1 billion, and with the trust and innovation from JP Morgan payments whole ecosystem, you can drive growth while protecting your business.

Okay, David.

Sean Parker enters the picture.

Here we go.

So Sean Parker had of course started Napster with Sean Fanning back in the late 1990s.

And after the whole Napster saga, Parker ended up starting the email contact list company called Plaxo, which was kind of its own proto-social network and pioneered email address book exploitation and exporting.

Which is how every social company got its start.

Facebook did a ton of this, LinkedIn did a ton of this, what''s app did this?

Exactly.

It pioneered the first bootstrap viral social network mechanic.

Hey, let me see who all the people you know are, so that on this new thing, that you want to be connected to all the people you know, you''re connected to all the people you know.

Oh, by the way, we might also invite all the people that you''ve ever contacted.

Yep.

So Sean and his co-founders at Plaxo, raise money for Plexo from venture capitalists.

And not just any venture capitalists, the best venture capitalists from Sequoia capital.

And all is going well, Plexo''s going fine.

Sir Michael Moritz is on the board of the company.

Anyway, after a couple of years, Sean Parker ends up getting kicked out of the company by the board.

Now, Sean wasn''t exactly the most like reliable employee and definitely was quirky.

But the result of this is Sean''s everlasting enmity for Sequoia and paranoid distrust of all venture capitalists and company boards.

This is going to become very, very, very important here in ASEC.

So rewind slightly back to the spring of 2004 when the team is still at Harvard.

Sean is living in Palo Alto, and one of his housemates, Girlfriends, who''s, I believe, a student at Stanford, pulls up the Facebook.com on her laptop.

And it''s kind of like the scene where this happens in the social network movie.

Sean is like, holy crap.

This is it.

This is the winning social network.

And Sean, I believe, had actually been an advisor to Friendster as well.

So he was like between Plexo and Napster, Friendster, really believed social networking was going to become a thing.

Totally.

And it is kind of crazy to think about unless you had a student show you on their computer, this is what Facebook is, there''s no real way for you to know other than the sign-up page.

Right.

Which you can''t get past it and see how alive the thing is.

Yep.

So Sean, being the enterprising person that he is, He cold emails the company''s business email address and asked to set up a meeting and Eduardo Saverin replies to Sean is like, oh cool, you''re the co-founder of Navster.

Yeah.

They set up a dinner in New York City.

This is while the spring semester is still going on at Harvard and Mark and Eduardo and Sean all get dinner together and Mark and Sean really bond.

'And Sean, I believe, had actually been an advisor to Friendster as well.

So he was like between Plexo and Napster, Friendster, really believed social networking was going to become a thing.

Totally.

And it is kind of crazy to think about unless you had a student show you on their computer, this is what Facebook is, there''s no real way for you to know other than the sign-up page.

Right.

Which you can''t get past it and see how alive the thing is.

Yep.

So Sean, being the enterprising person that he is, He cold emails the company''s business email address and asked to set up a meeting and Eduardo Saverin replies to Sean is like, oh cool, you''re the co-founder of Navster.

Yeah.

They set up a dinner in New York City.

This is while the spring semester is still going on at Harvard and Mark and Eduardo and Sean all get dinner together and Mark and Sean really bond.

Mark is super pumped to meet him.

But that''s about it, like there''s no, you know, discussion about, you know, what''s cool, a billion dollars, you know, et cetera, et cetera, as dramatized in the movie, that doesn''t happen.

They kind of think that they''re just going to go their separate ways.

Right.

Nice to meet you.

I don''t think even Mark knows yet that he''s moving to California this summer.

No, totally not.

So here we are now in June.

The Facebook crew has moved out to Palo Alto.

know, they''re walking down the street one evening.

Sean is also walking down the same street in Palo Alto, sees them and is like, Hey, it''s the Facebook guys.

And at this point, Sean Parker was living in a different house, specifically the house of his girlfriend''s parents, not a good situation.

And he makes a split second decision right there on the industry to insert himself into Facebook and is like, hey, I''m actually looking for a place to stay.

Do you think I can crash with you guys in the crash pad for the summer?

And he joins the crew.

And this is how it all starts.

That is wild.

Yeah, it''s like a, you ever play old school, like Super Nintendo, role playing games, like Japanese RPGs, like Final Fantasy or whatnot?

it''s been a while.

I mean, it''s just like you meet somebody on the street and they join the party and like, you know, you always know the character on the street that''s going to join the party because their pixel sprite is more highly detailed than the regular NPC picks.

I mean, this is exactly what it is like here.

Sean Parker had a very detailed pixel sprite.

Yes.

So while he''s there, you know, living in the house, crashing with the college students, he basically takes Mark aside and he''s like, Look, you''ve got something really special here.

I have been in your shoes.

Let me tell you exactly what is gonna happen this summer.

You have created something magical.

You''re now out here in Silicon Valley.

You are going to be the bell of the ball.

All the venture capitalists out here, all the big companies, they''re gonna wine and dine you.

They''re gonna court you.

They''re gonna tell you you''re great and they''re gonna wanna invest in your company.

And then they''re going to turn around and they are going to screw you.

They''re going to take control of your board.

They''re going to force you to bring in, quote, unquote, professional management.

They''re going to kill all the magic.

Growth is going to slow.

Then they''re going to blame you.

And then they''re going to fire you.

And then they''re going to put the company up for sale.

And here''s the thing.

To this point in history, he really wasn''t wrong.

He was absolutely right.

There wasn''t founders fund yet.

There wasn''t a 16z yet.

there wasn''t like the notion of founder friendliness.

What venture capitalists did is they invested in founders companies and then brought in management to take them to the next level.

It''s what happened at eBay.

It''s what happened at Google.

This is a pattern that happened over and over and over again.

And usually they would try to do it with the sort of help and support of the entrepreneur to build this like really great team together.

But oftentimes that backfired and And they just hot swapped the CEO with a big grown-up manager and a nice suit.

Yep.

And that was not the wrong playbook until this moment in time, because as we''ve been talking about, until now, if you wanted to scale something you needed money, you needed permission, you needed business people, you needed deals, you needed contacts.

Yeah.

That''s true.

The open web kind of changed the hard requirement on that.

Yes, and I think Sean, as bitter as he was about his own experience, I think he probably also recognized that and recognized that the Facebook and Mark had the potential to start a new paradigm of how to do this differently.

So Sean says to Mark, look, if you just go out on your own, that''s what''s going to happen.

I am going to take you under my wing and make sure that that does not happen.

and I''m going to help you reset up the company so that you permanently control the board and no one can ever fire you because you are what is important here.

And I''m going to help you go about fundraising but I''m going to make sure we find the right people who are cool with that stipulation number one because if you go try and do it by yourself like you don''t know enough, you don''t know these people, you''re not going to find the right folks.

and it''s kind of wild.

I mean, Sean was also in a position to take advantage of Mark and the company, and he didn''t.

There was some nice self-interest in all of this.

It''s not like this was like charitable.

He ends up being the president of Facebook.

And he ends up with a pretty decent chunk for a non-founder and he ends up with a board seat.

Now granted, it''s technically Mark''s board seat, but Sean''s the one sitting in it.

Totally, but it would have been really easy for him to do one or two things.

You know, one obviously take advantage of Mark in the company and get a lot more for himself.

Two, I think he also could have been so jaded by the Plexo experience to say we shouldn''t raise venture capital at all.

But actually what he counsels Mark to do is the right thing.

No, we should raise venture capital.

We should professionalize and the whole Silicon Valley machinery really can help us, but we''re gonna do it in the right way on our terms.

Yep.

I think he just really wanted to help Mark win the game.

I think you''re right.

The other thing that Sean does by all accounts is, he makes sure that everyone in the house that summer gets equity in the company.

Okay, so what''s Wirehog?

What''s the second project that''s going on here?

Yes.

I really would love to know what Sean thought when Mark and the crew told them about Wirehug.

Wirehug was basically going to be a captive Napster to Facebook.

Everybody on Facebook, in these private networks, walled gardens, what is something that college students really, really wanted to do and was happening internally on college servers all the time?

Share files, share music, share movies.

Wirehug was going to be a product to make this happen.

And actually, legend has it.

I think in Stephen Levy''s book, while they''re talking about this Sean Parker actually comes up with a name for the product, it''s like, oh, if you launch this, you should actually call it Dropbox.

No way.

Yeah, like a year before Dropbox, the actual company gets founded.

That''s so funny.

But they really are sort of thinking of themselves.

This is almost like incubator lab.

I don''t really understand how this is true, but they really did convince themselves at their current front runner for the product they were most excited about was wirehog.

And Facebook might be like a good distribution vehicle for it, or maybe at some point they don''t even focus on Facebook anymore and they go all in on wirehog.

And they''re actively talking about this insanity while speaking with investors about raising capital.

Yes.

So to the investors that Sean goes out and helps them find.

Sean at this point knows basically everybody and Silicon Valley.

And he''s like, okay, I need the pretty tight window of people who A have money, B know what they''re doing, and C are okay with our terms that Mark is going to control the board and control the company.

So we need an individual, not an institution.

So he calls two angel investors, who he knows pretty well, and he thinks might be the right fit.

One is Reid Hoffman, who Reid had been running LinkedIn, and Sean had been in this early social networking thing.

And he just started LinkedIn. They actually knew each other because Reed was an early investor in Friendster.

So Sean calls up Reed.

And he also calls up Mark Pinkis.

Mark had been Sean''s boss at an internship that he had in high school.

And then Mark had gone on to invest in Napster when they started Napster as a company.

And we should say who Mark Pinkis is for anyone who doesn''t know.

Mark would eventually start Zingha.

Yes.

It could become a very important person and company in the Facebook ecosystem.

The maker of Farmville.

Yes.

So, Pinkis and Reed meet up with Sean and Mark and they''re just blown away by the Facebook.

And Ben, as you say, Mark starts talking about wirehog and apparently Reed is like, no, no, no, stop talking about this wirehog thing.

I''m running LinkedIn. I can tell you this is special.

Do the Facebook thing.

Not only do the Facebook thing, but music is kryptonite as a space right now, because of what Napster did to the music labels.

How is Sean not the one being like, stay a thousand yards away from music, my God.

I mean, amazingly a couple years later, Sean being so open-minded, I mean, he was one of the ones he really helped Spotify get going.

Yep.

And really broker the relationship with Mark for Daniel and Mark to hit it off and obviously the Spotify to have a huge amount of growth on Facebook.

Totally.

So, okay, read.

Real excited.

He''s like, no, the Facebook, focus on the Facebook.

Your user numbers are what?

Your engagement is what?

Your retention is what?

Your Dow Mauritio is what?

Oh my God.

So, reads like, look, I''m running LinkedIn. Pinkist and I don''t have that much money together.

We''ll give you some, but we can''t fund a whole round for you.

And they''re kind of conflicted, Both with Friendster and LinkedIn, but he''s like, I think I know the perfect person who can put this together I worked with this guy at PayPal My old colleague from PayPal who actually as luck would have it is Thinking about starting his own venture capital fund.

This could be a really good fit Why don''t you meet Peter teal And Peter, yes, indeed, was just in the process of starting what would become Founder''s Fund.

Ben, you already alluded to this, but like, Founder''s Fund was such a radical idea when Peter started it.

The idea being baked into the name that they will always side with founders and never push a founder out of a company.

I was shocked.

I mean, it just, it''s so easy to forget this, but it was just 20 years ago.

So the idea that a venture capitalist makes an investment in a company and they are not the controlling shareholder was blasphemous just 20 years ago.

Totally blasphemous.

Of course PayPal has its own crazy history where you can understand why Peter would arrive at this conclusion, but he really was like maybe the only person in Silicon Valley that hit that Venn diagram that I talked about a minute ago of like super legitimate would would actually help the company and help them navigate Silicon Valley had money because the PayPal ex had just happened and was going to be cool with Mark controlling the company.

Yeah.

It''s a one of one intro to make.

I mean, it probably would have had to be someone else in the PayPal mafia that kind of fits that.

Yep.

But I don''t think at that time, you know, Elon wasn''t doing investing.

I don''t think there was anybody else who really could have done it.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That''s a crazy counterfactual thinking about if Elon had invested in Facebook instead of Peter Teal.

Right.

What if Elon hadn''t started SpaceX?

He wasn''t just as good a position.

Totally.

Had Rulof gone to Sequoia yet?

If he had, he would have just started.

This is effectively the pool of financiers who could have done this deal.

All right.

But Sequoia wasn''t going to do this deal under those terms, so Rulof couldn''t have done it.

Yep.

It was maybe one of two with the other one potentially being Elon.

Wow, that would be a really different world that we would be living in today.

Yep.

Okay.

So they take the idea to Peter.

In the meeting, Reed brings along a young guy who''s working for him at LinkedIn, a Matt Kohler, and come help, you know, talk to Peter, evaluate this from an investing standpoint.

point, they strike a deal that Peter is going to lead around of $500,000.

Read and Mark Pinkis are each going to invest $37,500.

Peter is going to do the rest at a $5 million pre-money valuation.

So $5.5 million post.

Which you know on the woodhead is like laughable now.

On the other hand, at this point in time, for a bunch of kids who started this a couple months ago, it''s crazy that this would be worth $5 million.

Out of $5 million valuation, the multiple cents then has been about $250,000 x.

So that takes us to the end of the summer.

So everybody now has to make a decision.

Do they stay in Palo Alto and keep working full time on Facebook?

Or do they go back to school?

So Eduardo never came out in the first place, so he did his internship in New York.

He goes back to Harvard and starts his junior year.

Chris Hughes also goes back to Harvard, starts his junior year, graduates in 2006 and then rejoins Facebook after graduation.

Andrew McCullum stays in Palo Alto for a couple years and then goes back to Harvard later and completes his degree, he takes the Bill Gates road, not traveled option.

Dustin never goes back, stays with the company until 2008 when he leaves to start Asana, and Mark, I think, probably never really even considered going back.

Yeah, at this point, the 70% stat keeps being true.

Despite the fact that they keep opening all these new schools, it keeps being true that 70% of people who have ever signed up are daily active users.

So I think Mark realizes, oh, I have created one of the most engaging technology applications ever.

Yes.

And certainly at this point, the combination of Sean, Peter, Reed, Mark Pinkis, all advising and being part of the company, if they know, and they have certainly helped him realize that.

Adam D''Angelo does go back to Caltech, and then through AM, I guess, remotely helps collaborate with the company until he graduates, and in 2006, and becomes CTO, officially.

Got it.

Sean, like we said, his impact on the company was huge.

I really want to underscore this again, Mark having full control over the company as we are going to see time and time and time again as we go through the story here makes all the difference in the world.

And that is one hundred percent because of Sean Parker.

Yep.

So how long is Sean at the company?

Not very long, because at some point in time, the next spring.

So it''s like nine total months at the company.

Yeah, I think about nine total months.

Sean ends up leaving the company after charges get filed against him as a result of some drug incidents at a house party during a trip to North Carolina.

Charges do eventually get dropped, But in the meantime, the decision is made, hey, this is not something the company is going to get sucked into.

Yeah.

He immediately joins where else founders fund, which Peter, partially on the back of this Facebook investment has now set up and raised officially.

And like we said, Sean goes on to find and fund and really help nurture Spotify through his role of founders fund.

Yep, it''s kind of amazing thinking about founders fund raising capital on the back of this investment one pitches We invested in Facebook.

The flip side of it is we just invested in a company We''re currently holding it flat because there''s been no markup yet from any other investors and they''re not generating any revenue Well, let''s talk about other investors by this point kind of towards the end of spring semester to 2005.

Facebook had now dropped the the become just Facebook.

That was one of Sean Parker''s final impacts on the companies.

He actually negotiated the domain name purchase of Facebook.com.

I didn''t know that.

Yeah.

I believe they bought it for $200,000.

Which actually was a good chunk of that venture money.

Yeah.

Right.

Because it was 500K that raised before.

It was 500K.

Yep.

And they''re actively spending that.

The company has never consumed that much capital, but they are having to spend it on servers.

As they stand up new colleges, they are having to go into data centers and rack servers or rent servers on a monthly basis, and the server bills are starting to add up, especially as they scaled to how many schools were they add in the fall of 2004?

Several hundred.

Well, Sean Parker introduced Mark to Western technology investment, WTI, the debt fund, yeah.

Yeah.

And so they basically invented venture debt.

And so they make a $300,000 loan.

It''s like, I think like a revolving credit line in the fall of 2004.

And that comes with warrants that if the company ever goes public that they can then exercise, they do a deal again, the next spring for another $300,000.

So they''re in for $600,000.

I spoke with someone years ago who told me this ended up being phenomenally, phenomenally successful and the warrant exercise on this, I think is the greatest venture debt deal of all time.

Has to be.

Nice.

Spring 2005, Excel comes in, leads a series A, $12.7 million at a $98 million post money evaluation.

That''s sort of like crazy in and of itself for the time.

And though, still being okay with Mark having board control.

Yes.

Which, you know, one thing for like, okay, at the angel round, maybe like that''s still pretty crazy, but whatever, this is the angel round.

But like, no, like a real venture capital firm, real series, a 2005, $800 million dollar valuation, be being okay with that.

That was wild.

Oh, also C, getting less than 20% of the company.

Yes.

Like, rule of thumb venture investing back in the day was you need at least 20% of the company, ideally more like 25 or 30.

Yes.

So, Kevin Fruci who ran down the deal and did the diligence at Excel and Jim Breyer, who was the partner and took the board seat.

This is one of the all time great venture investments.

And so it''s worth talking about some of the deal mechanics.

It was the very first post.com institutional venture capital deal where the founder maintained control.

Certainly the norm was as soon as a VC gets involved.

It is a VC controlled board and company.

The other thing that''s worth noting is this is a company getting a $98 million valuation.

Now the silly land that we live in now are like this happens all the time.

This didn''t happen.

And we were only just coming out of the dot com era.

So eyeballs and clicks had just had four years of demonization from everyone from the press to the public to limited partners.

In fact, Excel had limited partners drop out of this fund who were LPs previously, including your beloved Princeton, including Harvard.

I mean, big and I think Stanford was one of the only ones that really stuck with them for this $400 million fund, and they''re kind of looking at this realizing this might be one of the greatest companies of all time, and we are going to have to do the type of deal that everyone got raked over the coals for five years ago in the mania for doing, and no one is doing this type of deal in this environment.

But it''s Facebook, so we''re going to do it.

I think the level of risk and reputation risk that that they took on this cannot be underscored enough.

Totally.

I was trying to think of, were there any other deals like this that you could even kind of point to as a comparable from the past, and the only one I can think of was the Google Series A, which was $25 million at a $100 million post-money valuation split between Michael Moritz from Sequoia and John Doar from Kleiner Perkins.

But it was in the .com run-up.

Exactly, exactly.

It was a totally, totally different paradigm and the legend has it, I don''t know if this is apocryphal or not, is that after making the investment, more it''s told Don Valentine, it''s Sequoia, never have we paid so much for so little.

And I think he was actually referring to the small amount of equity that they got by having to split the deal in Google.

So yeah, in the dot com bubble that happened, but like that this would happen in 2005.

Excel went way out on a limb for this.

Yeah, so some other interesting deal points, $1.1 million of this $12.7 million round was done by Jim Breyer personally.

Wow.

Yeah.

The shares were acquired at 4.5 cents per share.

Facebook just recently hit $600 a share.

So Excel and their limited partners and Jim, for anyone who''s still holding the shares after they distributed them, that is a 13,000X return.

Another interesting thing on this, do you know the whole Don Graham dynamic with this deal?

Yes.

The original deal was that Don Graham from the Washington Post was going to invest in it wasn''t going to be a VC deal.

That was at a $60 million valuation.

Excel comes in over the top And in part of the negotiation to get it up to this $98 million deal, there was actually a secondary.

Oh, wow.

Three million went to Mark, Dustin, and Sean as a secondary in this deal.

Wow.

I had no idea.

Yep.

Well, I mean, add to the litany of things that were not done back then.

This is Facebook having all the leverage and full deal control in negotiating this series A Wow, and still it was one of the best venture capital investments of all time Absolutely, man, that is freaking wild.

Yeah Wow, okay, well that is a lot of hype to live up to Which brings us now to the summer of 2005 where Mark motivated by this perhaps, I hadn''t quite thought about that, announces to the company his product road map for the summer.

And it is a six-point product plan.

Number one, a redesign of the site.

Bye-bye, Facebook guy.

Number two, a photo application.

Which, by the way, photos got written by like one guy in two weeks.

Yes, move fast and break things.

Yep.

Number three, a personalized newspaper based on all of your friends'' activity.

Number four, an events feature.

Number five, a local business product.

And number six, a sort of vague idea for a feature called I''m Board, which would let users on the site who were bored consume media and play games.

That''s a pretty big feature mandate.

This is a freaking wild.

So now, okay, of that, I think only the redesign and photos would actually ship in 2005.

Maybe events did too, I''m not entirely sure, but this is incredible.

Photos, newsfeed, platform, which is really what this I''m bored feature is.

Summer 2005, it''s all right there in the vision.

and Mark thinks they can accomplish all of this by the end of the summer.

And the wild thing is they do accomplish all of this in the next two years, which two big points on this.

For any other company, these are all like multi-year long development processes.

Well, any one is its own company.

Exactly.

Photos is flicker.

There are independent didn''t game platform companies out there.

Many clip, et cetera.

Yeah, flash games.

What were some of the other ones?

Events, event bright.

Yep.

Personalized newspaper.

Well, that becomes a true, true innovation in newsfeed.

But I think at the time there was a lot of buzz and talk about personalized portals and Yahoo was really big on this.

And Google was even kind of big on this.

Like, oh, make this your homepage.

Oh, I, Google.

Do you remember I, Google?

Yes, I, Google.

Exactly.

And I think that might have been somewhat of the inspiration, although obviously Mark was thinking way bigger than that, but like, yeah, again, local business product, Yelp.

Each one of these under the old paradigm was its own company, and Mark was like, no, this is all part of Facebook, crazy, super crazy.

And this really, I think, speaks to the genius of Mark as a product strategist.

It''s one thing to say I''m going to add a lot of random features to my site, and I''m going to throw spaghetti against the wall.

This was not a random grouping of features.

Everything reinforced one another and drove the engagement loop of the site.

So just as one example, let''s take from this roadmap that Mark lays out, events.

Let''s start there.

events and parties, planned on Facebook, get tagged with who''s going to attend the events.

All of those tags get published out as activity to newsfeed.

That drives interest in FOMO among the friend networks, so more friends come to the actual event.

At the event, photos get taken, and now there''s more people there.

Well, those photos get posted back to the site afterwards and they all get tagged with the people who were there who are in the photos.

All of that becomes activity that they can get published to newsfeed.

That generates more desire from more people who see that on Facebook in the newsfeed to either engage with the photos and like and comment on them, or if they''re hearing about it from their friends and they''re not yet on Facebook to now register for Facebook and get involved in this loop.

All of that now gets published back to newsfeed.

So now it''s time for the next party, and you can see how this just grows and builds on itself over and over and over again.

It''s funny, as you''re saying all this, it sounds like very old hat, like almost boring.

Of course it does all of that.

At the time it was so revolutionary.

Everything I just described was there within the next 18 months.

So photos I think was like late summer of05.

Interestingly, photos did not originally include photo tagging.

Photo tagging was like a pretty new concept.

I think Flickr may have had it, but the idea that like you''re tagging a person, and then you can go browse that person''s profile by photos they''ve been tagged in.

That wasn''t brand new innovation.

That is a mechanic that was not thought of in social networks before.

If you think about what Friendster and Myspace were, you could upload a limited set of photos, which by the way, you''d have to delete one to add another.

Yes.

So my space only allowed you to have eight photos maximum at the time, and this is a bend what you''re describing of person tagging in photos Incredible innovation, right that drives the whole viral loop.

And this is a through line through the whole episode What social media or social networks are Definitionally changes every year and often Facebook was the one in the early days to push the envelope and say this is what it means to be a social network.

In the later years, it was Facebook''s competitors that then they had to sort of adopt that functionality.

But the idea that a social network includes an infinite number of photos that you can tag and give XY coordinates on the photo to map to a specific person that is another entity in the social network, that was actually a new component to what it meant to be a social network.

And as you''re saying with newsfeed, that wouldn''t happen for another, what was that late summer of 2006 or something?

September 2006.

Yeah, so another year, year and a half after this, that completely turned what social media, social networking was on its head again.

Yes, we''re going to talk all about it in a sec.

To this point, a social network is a set of static profile pages that you can navigate to.

And if you go to home, like the root, you know, Facebook.com slash, Ash instead of slash profile PHP.

It''s pretty useless.

Like the homepage is actually an uninteresting place to hang out.

There is no, hey, let me see what''s going on in my network.

Yes, until newsfeed.

Okay, but before we get to that, 2005.

To your broader point here though, yeah, for the first six or seven years of its life, Facebook was a change maker, defining what social networking was.

And then after that, it became a change taker.

And we''ll talk about this when it happens, but like, again, the mental flexibility of Mark in the company to be like, okay, I''m not going to have pride about that anymore.

I''m going to adapt and still win.

It was incredible.

Very Microsoftian.

Very Microsoftian.

Okay.

So even this, even though it takes two years to roll out the full roadmap, photos, events, but especially photos.

The 2005-2006 school year is just off the charts for growth, sharing, engagement among college students.

Ben, you found a like incredible stat about Facebook''s page views, right?

Yeah, this stat is crazy.

By November of 2005, they were getting 230 million page views daily, which means that they had passed Google Google.

In page views.

Wow.

Google, the company started six years earlier.

And the reason is because when you''re on Google, you do like one or two searches, and then you go to your destination.

On Facebook, you get caught in an hour''s long trance of looking at everybody you know and what they''re doing, right?

Which was already the case when it was basically text only, but adding photos.

I mean, oh my God, every photo is a page view with such a small user base at that point in time.

I think what probably certainly less than 10 million users to have 200 million plus page views every single day and be passing Google and traffic is wild.

I mean, let''s say it''s 10 million.

It''s 23 page views per day per person.

That''s assuming that every single person who is a monthly user is accessing it every day and loading a page 23 times.

Right.

Right.

In our mobile age now, that doesn''t really sound like much.

I bet the number of photos that someone scrolls through on Instagram is way higher than that.

But for the time that interactivity was just nuts.

I mean, certainly flicker my space, friendster couldn''t hold a candle to that type of engagement.

Yeah.

So here''s their user growth.

In June of 05, as you mentioned, they were at 3 million by September of 05.

They were at 5 million users.

That was 10x their user base just a year ago in September of 04 and almost a third of all US college students were included in that 5 million.

So by September of 05 they had a third of US college students of their 5 million users that they had about 18 months in 70% were daily active 85% were weekly actively active, 93% were monthly active.

Wow.

Those are just insane numbers.

Yes.

I could go on and on and on.

But one interesting thing to also point out at this period of time, October of 2005, they were up to 8.3 million users.

They were the 10th most visited site on the internet.

But the important part is they were doing a million dollars a month in revenue.

They had actually started figuring out the advertising business model.

So here we are 19 months after founding there no longer burning capital.

Yes.

Well, when you say figured out the advertising business model They just had such a high volume of page views that they didn''t have to figure anything out Right, you just plug in some crappy ad networks and like print money.

Fair.

Yeah, you''re right Actually, I completely misspoke.

I would say that they were nowhere near figuring out the advertising business model But they had a traffic machine.

They were able to, through alchemy, turn page views into revenue, but they had not, by any means, figured out their business model.

And in this world where startups glorify, raising capital, burning huge amounts of money, delay monetization, and then having these amazing screaming returns when they finally do turn on the money faucet, Facebook was just the opposite.

They lost money and not that much money for like a year and a half and then from that point on they were just profitable.

Yes.

So the 2005-2006 academic school year, incredible for the company.

Everything we just talked about.

But there were a couple yellow flags, shall we say, that popped up.

During that year, Mark, of course, was already starting to think about, So, well, how can this keep getting bigger?

People graduate from college.

This is great in colleges, but like, I don''t want to just build a college site.

I want this to be a lot bigger, and obviously that was what Excel was investing into at that valuation.

So they launched two sort of tests throughout the year.

One was opening up Facebook to high school students, and the other one was opening Facebook book up to workplace groups and both of them kind of flopped.

And for different reasons, right?

The workplace ones, they were like the workplace thing is gonna be awesome because it''s authenticated email addresses, the same way that the colleges had authenticated email addresses.

Most high schools don''t have authenticated email addresses so we expect these workplace networks to work better.

Yep, but the problem was going into workplace networks, people didn''t want to share with their colleagues.

I don''t want some low-res party photos of me from last night showing up on my workplace.

And I think also just the density wasn''t there.

It was violating the principles that got them there of like this thing needs to be alive.

And every way we frackedily spread out needs to be bringing that nuclear reactor of what''s happening along with it.

Going straight into workplaces like you''ve got 60 year olds and they''re like there''s gonna be nothing compelling for them right now.

Well, the extreme bear case on Facebook at this moment in time is you started with the group of people who are the most social and the most open to share in their entire lives.

You''ve already saturated a third of them.

Every single cohort that you add from here is probably going to be worse.

Yep.

And that was a very rational argument.

Now, high schools, as you say, failed for a different reason.

and there wasn''t the same standardized email architecture in high schools across the country.

It was just way more fragment and so you couldn''t elegantly set up these private networks in the same way.

Yeah, and in fact, what they ended up doing because I was in high school at this time, it was technically a different Facebook.

In fact, I will quote the homepage when you went to sign up if you went to Facebook.com in 2006, the title was Facebook as an online directory that connects people through social networks at schools.

Now there are two Facebooks, one for people in colleges, and one for people in high school.

The site is open to a lot of schools, but not everywhere yet.

We''re working on it.

And so if you signed up as a high schooler, you got the crappy one.

You had to log into hs.facebook.com.

And it looked mostly the same.

It had slightly different features.

But there was this weird thing where somebody who was already in college had to invite you.

It''s not like anyone could sign up for high school Facebook.

You needed a college student who went to high school with you to basically vouch for the fact that you are a real high school student And thus eligible to sign out for hs.facebook.com Right.

Oh man, I vaguely remember this of my younger friends who are still in high school asking for this and the subdomaining thing was that lasted for a long time because the college facebooks Were subdomained as a part of their like tech infrastructure you know, harvard.facebook.com only went to the set of servers that they had set up for that.

It made it all really easy from an infrastructure perspective.

I was on hs.facebook.com for a long time as a college student.

Right.

Yeah, because there had to just be one hs.facebook.com for all the high schools.

Yes, exactly.

And it meant that they needed to like manage scale and load balance really differently because very quickly, the largest network, or like certainly the largest subdomain, was the high school one.

And so I''d think like within a month or two of allowing high school signups, you know, high school as a whole was much, much, much larger.

And they had to solve for the technology constraint of what do we do with this?

It doesn''t behave like any of our college networks.

Yeah.

So the academic school year in the core college user segment went great.

But once Once you hit summer 2006, all those kids go on break and college growth stops for the moment.

So summer 2006 was kind of a scary moment for the company.

The initiatives to expand outside colleges were not going super well.

College growth had stopped for the moment.

And yeah, Ben, like you said, like very rational argument that like, okay, this thing is going to be a really interesting niche site for college students and how valuable is that?

Well, Viacom, which owned MTV, thought that that was worth $750 million, which is what they offered to buy the company for in the summer of 2006.

' signups, you know, high school as a whole was much, much, much larger.

And they had to solve for the technology constraint of what do we do with this?

It doesn''t behave like any of our college networks.

Yeah.

So the academic school year in the core college user segment went great.

But once Once you hit summer 2006, all those kids go on break and college growth stops for the moment.

So summer 2006 was kind of a scary moment for the company.

The initiatives to expand outside colleges were not going super well.

College growth had stopped for the moment.

And yeah, Ben, like you said, like very rational argument that like, okay, this thing is going to be a really interesting niche site for college students and how valuable is that?

Well, Viacom, which owned MTV, thought that that was worth $750 million, which is what they offered to buy the company for in the summer of 2006.

Well, there was another party that really, really wanted to own Facebook at this point in time, and that was Yahoo.

And Yahoo was willing to top Viacom and pay a billion dollars to buy the company.

So here we are, a billion dollar offer on the table and growth is slowing.

Exactly, exactly.

Exactly.

There''s this existential question Mark about the company.

Growth has slowed a lot.

You''ve got a billion dollars on the table, which is a lot of money, especially in those days.

It was shocking six years later when Facebook bought Instagram for a billion dollars.

This would have made the careers of everybody involved.

And Mark of course controls the company, controls the board, thanks to Sean Parker.

He doesn''t have to sell.

But the whole management team is like, yeah, we should probably simple.

And I think the board, you know, it''s hard to know.

They obviously know they can''t force him to sell.

But I suspect if you had asked all of their opinions and certainly Mark did, they probably would have been like, you know, it''s been a great run.

We should probably hit this bid.

So Mark actually agrees to the Yahoo deal.

Billion dollars is going to be all in stock.

Yahoo''s going to buy the company in the interim between when they shake hands on the deal.

And while the docs are being drafted, Yahoo announces their quarterly earnings and they have a bad quarter and the stock drops 20% and Terry Semmel, who was the CEO of Yahoo at the time, said, okay, the deal is, you know, for the same amount of stock.

So commensurately, the deal is now worth $800 million, not a billion dollars.

And that was history turning on a knife point.

And that was all Mark needed to say, you know what?

Thanks, but no thanks.

And this part of the story never gets told, the fact that actually, at first, Mark did not turn down the billion dollar offer from Yahoo.

Mark actually accepted, or at least said, let me turn over another card and get one inch closer to the negotiation being final.

You know, it wasn''t an outright rejection at first.

It was, yeah, come back with the papers.

Yep.

Totally.

That is not the way it gets talked about today.

But I think actually makes the story really kind of even more powerful.

It almost really did slip away.

Well, it''s certainly much more realistic.

It''s a simple and powerful story to say they just outright rejected it.

But that''s just never how these things go.

It''s like, uh, show me your real.

Yep.

Okay.

So analyzing, let''s say he just did turn it down outright.

Well, here''s a reasonable way to look at it.

If what you want to do is run a great company for the rest of your life, it actually was totally rational.

Mark has said publicly, I mean, it''s like 15, 18 years ago, I didn''t have any more ideas as good as Facebook.

But that''s like way undersell again.

There aren''t better companies to start.

Right.

Yes, it would have been nice to have certainty on a billion dollars or whatever percent of the billion mark owned at that point.

And also, a year before my space had gotten bought for $580 million.

Right, by news court.

So it''s like, geez, okay, twice as much as my space.

But rationally, if the optimization function is I wanna run the best company I can for a very long time, almost nobody has started a better company sense.

So if you''re looking at the engagement, You''re looking at the potential, the rational thing actually is just keep running this company because I''ll never discover something like it again.

Yep.

I completely agree with you and Mark has said so much in so many words to you and me personally that he''s not optimizing for financial outcome here.

He''s optimizing for impact.

And I think he likes running this company.

He would want to go start a similar company if he didn''t have this one.

Yes.

Yes, totally.

Also though, to a skill as a strategist, even at this very young age, yes, Ben, you and I just made a compelling argument about why you could have believed Facebook was going to top out with the college market at this point in time.

Mark knew, though, and he had planted the seeds that both newsfeed and open registration were going to be coming later that year.

And he was definitely making that calculus here, too.

I''m like, well, I don''t know what the probability necessarily is that there''s going to hit, but Mark had to believe like, A, if they do, they''re going to be really big.

And B, I think the probability is higher than the people around me think it is.

Yep, that''s totally fair.

Even if you weren''t going to bet on the growth, the user engagement was still currently great and you had a lot of reason to believe that it was going to get even greater.

And you compare all the metrics with friendster in MySpace as time went on got worse.

People churned, they''re daily active to monthly active, would just go down over time.

The page load times would take forever, especially with, well, actually with both, Friendster just was not architected properly.

It was a software engineering computer science issue.

MySpace was this weird thing that was sort of born out of this combined media conglomerate and they just never really had excellent tech architectural talent.

And so, as you sort of looked at not the high level metrics of how many users have ever signed up, because my space and friends are, I think, we''re still way ahead at this point.

If you looked at like, hmm, but how is this going to play out if it sort of keeps compounding?

And you looked at the deeper metrics, you kind of thought, oh, I''m running the better company by a lot.

Once especially, you know, we got to figure out the business, but I am running the better product by a lot.

Yep.

So, okay, to figuring out the business coming out of this episode with Yahoo.

They say no.

The whole management team churns.

The whole management team basically churns over the next set of months.

Mark gets religion on a couple of things.

And actually we should say not Dustin, but a lot of the people around the table who were expecting a nice cash payout and now aren''t getting one or are not pleased.

Yep.

Totally.

So what are they going to do?

The first thing is I think Mark had always operated the company this way, but now he gets real religion of like, we need to get more revenue and we need to focus on becoming truly cash flow positives so that we are never in a position again where we would even consider doing something like this.

So in August of 2006, they do the first partnership with Microsoft.

It''s funny that you know, the Microsoft Facebook relationship in some ways is sort of a precursor to the Microsoft soft open AI relationship today and how that gets built.

Here''s what it is.

Microsoft says, we''re going to take over selling all of the display ad inventory domestically within the US for Facebook.

And we will give you a guaranteed CPM that we can sell.

And then we are going to use this to help bootstrap our online services division, which, as we talked about in our Microsoft series, becomes super, super important, not only for their efforts launching Bing and making that into ultimately a successful business, but even more importantly for Azure that comes out of it.

Microsoft knows they need some scale to bootstrap up and get started with both the ad business but also just like the online services division period.

This is a ton of inventory.

You just think about the amount of page views that are happening here.

Suddenly, Microsoft''s problem is not how do we find enough inventory to sell?

Well, it''s how do we go find enough advertisers to actually fill all these slots on Facebook?

Yes.

And Microsoft have been trying to do this.

They tried to do this with MySpace a little bit earlier and they lost that deal to Google.

So they really need Facebook.

And on the other hand, this is a great deal for Facebook because Facebook sucks at selling ads and Facebook has no targeting or anything.

So they really shouldn''t justify high CPMs at this point.

Yeah.

Outsource it to a good third party network.

Right.

So this is like basically all of Facebook''s revenue for the next couple of years here.

So Facebook had made $9 million in revenue in 2005 when they were selling themselves.

This is Ben as you are saying like, hey, they''re starting to turn on ads in 2005.

It''s starting to work like $9 million.

That''s amazing for year two as a company.

Got to cash flow positive.

Got to cash flow positive.

In 2006, with this Microsoft partnership, that jumps to $48 million in revenue.

Oh, that''s where the money''s pick it is.

Now we''re talking.

And then the next year in 2007, again, I think almost all of this is Microsoft that goes to $153 million in revenue.

So like, okay, we are way out of any league where we could sit or selling ourselves here if we can control our own destiny.

Isn''t it wild thinking about you thought it was crazy to turn down a billion dollar offer or many people thought you were crazy and then just two years later that is only a six X revenue multiple and you''re tripling your over year.

Oh, and by the way, in the second iteration of this Microsoft partnership, which we will talk about in just a minute, it included an investment from Microsoft at a $15 billion valuation.

Oh, hold your horses.

Let''s finish this great 2006, 2007 arc, and then we''ll get there.

Yes.

Point being though, Mark made the right decision for all shareholders of Facebook to walk away from the Yahoo deal.

I mean, it''s at an all-time high.

And walking away from every deal ever he''s made the right decision.

Yes.

But like within a year, he made the right decision.

Yes.

Oh yeah, that''s true.

This became obviously a right fast.

Very fast, very fast.

So how does this happen?

Okay, Adam D''Angelo finally graduates from Caltech joins Facebook full-time as CTO.

I love that Adams are like second protagonist here.

I don''t know.

I don''t know if you did that intentionally, but yeah.

Well, he was right there.

I mean, they were at Exeter together.

Like, I don''t think you can separate it out.

Yeah.

And, you know, I think here, part of the reason why Adam keeps coming into the story is he is a really, really great technologist.

And even though So he''s young, same age as Mark, when he now arrives full time as CTO, this is when Facebook starts to be taking the steps to be building like real technology infrastructure.

So before Adam joins full time, the team was shipping new code to the website, like at a high velocity relative to everybody else out there, you know, it was weekly ish, maybe every couple days, you know, maybe even up to daily, like, well, they were a web company For the first time in history, you actually could.

All these companies with big client and Microsoft would ship every three years with a service pack once a year.

It''s a whole new era where all you have to do is, you know, upload some new PHP code to the FTP server and then boom, the application behaves differently.

The next time someone pulls down the page, it''s the new technology era of interpreted language is running on web servers in a browser.

Now that products are in browsers, meant you could architect your company differently and ship differently.

Yes, and when Adam becomes officially a CTO, it''s like, actually, we should probably just ship multiple times a day.

We should just be shipping all the time.

And also, we should probably start recruiting like a real top tier engineering team.

Because remember, it''s still kind of nuclear winter for startups.

Great tech talent is available.

So they start going and recruiting like really, really top tier engineering hires and it''s a pretty compelling offer like a we''ve got real revenue from this Microsoft partnership where the best funded start up in the valley.

People want to buy us for a billion dollars we turn them down.

That''s all sort of the financial reasons to take it.

For a lot of people too it was like such a breath of fresh air.

I think Facebook was potentially maybe the first company first startup to have an open office plan, like just everything about how they ran the company was different.

It was the prototypical startup.

I mean, to this day, early Facebook is still what most startup culture is aspiring to be.

I think often without knowing it, I mean, everything from the sort of posters on the walls with your mantras and your values to almost having like an employment brand that you really care about cultivating to the idea of like we''re having just as much fun together socially as we are working together.

I think the modern startup culture, especially when you factor in the shipping every day open office, why comedy or kind of trains companies to become like Facebook was a hundred percent.

I mean there was Google out there which had a lot of this element, but it was a very different thing.

It was very academic, very wonky.

These guys were hackers and they shipped, you know, and they were all in it together.

The other thing that was basically true is they were not really interested in recruiting industry veterans, especially on the technical side.

And Mark says this in early talks that he was just prioritizing raw intelligence over experience.

So one of those super intelligent, super talented young engineers with a high slope who joined And back in Fallout 5 was an engineer named Chris Cox, who joined from the Stanford AI Lab.

And Chris joins a team of other young smart engineers, led by Ruchi Sangvi and Andrew Bosworth, working on Mark''s personalized newspaper product idea.

Ruchi was one of Facebook''s very first engineers, and along with her husband, a D.T. the Argerwall, they run South Park Commons now.

Boss was two years ahead of Mark at Harvard and had actually been Mark''s TA in the intro to artificial intelligence CS class that he took, and then he later joined the company.

Which is actually not how he ended up getting a job, but they did happen to cross paths that way before.

Yes, Boss went to Microsoft, I think, before joining Facebook.

Yep, just for a few years.

So the three of them start working on newsfeed.

And so we''ve talked about things like photos and the fundamental architecture of the site.

Newsfeed required like a whole new level of engineering prowess to get this thing to work.

Like you''re not just going to code this up in PHP.

Like photos also required real engineering.

But newsfeed was like pushing the state of the art of what was possible in technology and on the internet.

So the first question you have to ask yourself, if you''re a good product designer, developer, capital allocator, someone in Mark''s shoes saying, should we do this, is, do people want this?

If we build this, will it be valuable?

The reason they knew it would be valuable is because the company is data obsessed and they watch the analytics like a hawk to figure out what are people doing on our site.

And they notice this behavior where people were browsing to other people''s profiles cells just to look at them and see if anything changed.

The user was doing the heavy compute lifting rather than having a personalized newspaper of just bouncing around to a bunch of people''s profiles and saying, anything new here.

So there was an engineer who did something really kind of hacky because they didn''t want to at first put all the engineering resources into building out something like newsfeed, which is, well, when something changes for some period of time, we''ll just highlight it in yellow.

Yes.

So it''s easy for you as you''re bouncing around a different profiles to just see, oh, hey, this thing changed and That totally worked.

They watched the lift and that and they''re like, well, it''s a good feature people like that So that sort of gave them the confidence of we should find a way to make it more obvious to you when new updates happen when things change Technically, David for people who aren''t in the sort of tech ecosystem Why is it so difficult to build something like a newsfeed because now we''re all trained to believe that like a feed is You know, a primitive that is available to you as a developer when you''re building a product because feeds are everywhere.

Feeds are the core feature of most products when you hit the homepage at some sort of feed.

That was not true at the time.

That was not true in any product.

I actually challenge you right now.

Think back to 2005, what was a feed on the web?

What was sort of an infinite scrolling?

They didn''t exist.

This was the first one.

This was the invention of the feed.

Like maybe you''ve got Reddit and Dig and you could sort of make an argument that their feeds their paginated rankings of stories.

So you could see like, oh, what are the most important stories?

But even that''s a pretty different fundamental thing.

I don''t think Reddit had launched yet.

Dig may be exist, but yes, as you said.

Oh, yeah.

Reddit was in the first YC batch, which was 05, so it wasn''t really, it was right around this same time.

Okay.

So how do you make a feed?

Well, if you are an algorithms developer, the way you would sort of think of it is, okay, well, first, I need to pick a point in time, and from that point in time, and let''s call that maybe the last time someone looked at their feed, I need to store that timestamp, and now I need to go look at every single profile of someone that you are connected to, so this is n and download or cache all of their recent updates since that time period.

So I need to like store that somewhere.

I need a new place to store a copy of all of this information that lives on someone''s profile or at least pointers to that on everybody''s profile.

And I need that to happen for every user.

So now it''s n squared.

Every single person on the entire Facebook needs to have something running in the background that is looking at every other person on Facebook since a particular time.

And then that compute and storage all needs to happen fast enough such that by the time they want to go check the feed again, it''s happened again.

And obviously like now that happens in real time.

And I think it was something like every three hours.

There was like a new batch.

Yeah.

It was four times a day when it initially launched.

There was like a four-ex a day refreshment.

Okay.

So every six hours.

Yeah.

It was a cron job because they didn''t have enough memory to run it in real time.

That''s right.

They needed to happen on separate boxes to run this process, cash the results, and then when you loaded your newsfeed, go fetch them.

So this is like a whole new application using the same data that the company has to build in order to make newsfeed happen.

And so what you just described is all the technical work just making a feed possible.

On the back end, this doesn''t contemplate any of the front-end design or engineering or incredible permutations of how to display this data when it does come back, given a massive combinatorial problem of how might this data come back?

Exactly.

Then you need to make the feed actually compelling.

Like, I don''t really care about, you know, somebody who I''m tangentially connected to what they had for lunch today, but I really care about like a photo of Ben at the acquired meetup.

Right.

So now you''re telling me you want to rank order it by something other than...

Chronology.

Make another pass and figure out what I think is going to be the most interesting to you, which on its own is an incredibly difficult computer science problem.

What is interesting to you?

What data should we use to inform that decision?

Right.

Right.

Totally.

Who are your close friends?

Who do you care about the most?

What general news do you care about the most?

What types of stuff do you care about?

Do we have to put weights on every relationship in this entire complex friend graph between every single entity and how close they are and then re-rank that very often?

Eventually, yeah.

Yes.

So the team spends the better part of 2006 working on this by September it''s ready.

And so by September 5th, 2006, just in time for the new school year, they launch it.

And people noticed because they launch it like to everybody right away.

And this is a massive paradigm shift.

Yeah, it''s not opt in or anything.

This is Facebook changing the game of social.

Not opt in.

Everybody gets it right away.

They get 30,000 angry emails to support on the first day from users who are really upset about this.

10% of the entire global user base signs up for a group, a Facebook group called students against Facebook newsfeed.

I''m pretty sure I was part of this group.

The irony here is they had only just launched open groups across school networks days or weeks before.

So like they enable the tool of their own vitriol here.

And also guess how people are finding out about this group through news feed.

Yes.

This is the great irony of the whole situation.

There''s a literal panic in the streets.

There are people protesting outside the office.

There is somebody trying to use a crane to get into the third story, basically a TV truck is trying to cover what''s happening in the pandemonium.

And at the same time, despite everyone telling them, I hate this thing, it''s the worst thing ever.

If you look at the analytics, people love it.

People cannot get enough of scrolling through the new news feed.

And the reason they''re really upset is actually quite interesting.

They''re saying, oh, it''s sharing this with my whole network.

work.

Okay, but you updated it on your profile, which has always been public to your whole network.

And I think Facebook, for the first time, kind of stepped in it and realized, oh, even though technically this data has always, you know, we didn''t change how public or private it is.

It''s just as accessible.

People react really strongly when you change the ease of obtaining that information or whether it feels like you are pushing that information out versus someone is sort of pulling by going to your profile and viewing.

It went from pull to push.

Yes.

So it''s the start of the new school year.

We''ve just come off this sort of tumultuous summer.

Growth had slowed, walked away from the Yahoo deal.

There''s this revolt in the streets against newsfeed, which to mark''s mind, along with open and Reg, which was supposed to come like two days later of opening up Facebook to anybody.

They delayed that because of the newsfeed reaction.

But to Mark''s mind, the two of these things are like the big growth levers to reignite growth for Facebook.

The board, the management team, everybody''s like, all right, we got a roll newsfeedback.

People hate it.

This is PR 101.

We apologize.

We roll it back.

And to add a kicker, newsfeed actually significantly hurt Facebook''s revenue.

Because where do you think all the page views we''re coming from and all the refreshes?

Oh, loading a new ad.

Yep, loading all the profile views and clicking around.

So page views are actually going to go down in this new paradigm.

Every reason is aligned to roll this back.

So Ruchi and Chris and Bos though are looking at all the data and they''re like, totally crap.

Engagement is through the roof.

Yeah, people can''t get enough of this.

People say they hate it, but yeah, it looks like they can''t get enough of it.

So Mark decides that he is going to write a post on Facebook about this.

And it''s titled, calm down, breathe, we hear you.

and he announces that they''re going to launch a set of controls for you to control what of your activities get published to news feed and what don''t.

Which by the way, it sounds like something that Mark would say today.

I think this 2006 era is like the last time and then you would have had like a 17 year break and now we''re sort of getting that mark again.

Yes.

You can''t imagine and Mark circa 2018 saying, calm down, breathe, we hear you.

Yes, so it''s kind of a brilliant strategy of like, hey, I acknowledge that this was surprising.

We didn''t handle the rollout, right?

I''m seeing that you all actually like this in the data.

Let me give you some controls so that what you''re really worried about, you have some control over.

And then let''s just see what happens.

And within two weeks, it''s like magic.

Everybody just gets used to it and that this is now the way Facebook and social media operates and engagement continues to skyrocket.

Yeah.

But it''s funny.

I did just pull up.

We''ve been getting a lot of feedback about newsfeed.

We think they''re great products, but many of you are not immediate fans and have found them overwhelming and cluttered.

I don''t think clutter was what people were complaining about.

A little bit of redirection there.

Yeah.

It''s funny.

We didn''t take away any privacy options.

Your privacy options remain the same.

The privacy rules haven''t changed.

None of your information is visible to anyone who couldn''t see it before the changes, blah, blah, blah.

It''s like it is interesting.

It''s true and not relevant.

That''s not what people are mad about.

People are pretty aware that this is the same information.

Well, and I think to sort of set a theme here that we''re going to come back to several times.

the definition of what social media is is actually very fluid.

And it changes in the consumer''s mind.

I''d even say before this, there wasn''t social media, or at least Facebook wasn''t social media.

Facebook was a social network, but this was the first time they introduced a media component, a thing you would read.

Right.

Inspired by a newspaper.

Right.

And I think when these paradigm shifts happen.

People get upset because their expectations are being violated.

So it actually doesn''t really matter what the privacy is or isn''t.

It''s the expectations.

Right.

I''m glad you planted the seed because this will come back over and over again in their history of people now feel differently and the product needs to change with those societal expectations in order for people to not be upset about it.

Yep.

Unfortunately for the moment, I think the lesson that Mark and the company took from this experience was, well, we actually know what''s best and the user base will just get used to it whenever we make a change.

It just happened to be that that was true with newsfeed, but that wouldn''t always be true.

So originally, the two big initiatives newsfeed and open registration were supposed to basically launch together.

And they chose to do newsfeed first because it was gonna be a little bit easier to roll out and be more valuable to the core college audience that was just starting back for the new semester, the fall semester at school.

So they launched that first.

And then yet the original plan was open registration.

Facebook is now opened to anybody in the world who was gonna come two days later on September 7th.

They obviously put that on the shelf for a long time, two and a half weeks.

At the end of September, open registration launches, is anyone can sign up for Facebook.

This is another major, major change.

Before all these networks were siloed, you had to be part of a verified email address network to join Facebook.

Now anyone can sign up.

This is the beginning of, uh-oh, my mom is on Facebook.

Exactly, exactly, exactly.

Which ultimately would be a problem because that''s what created room for Instagram, for Snapchat, et cetera, et cetera.

But that would actually be down the line.

In a weird sort of perverse way, I think because of all the controversy around newsfeed, when open-reads launched, there wasn''t the same kind of controversy.

People were already desensitized or they had just been through newsfeed and they''re like, all right, yeah, whatever.

Nobody even really noticed that much, especially because the product experience didn''t change for the already engaged users.

years.

And to the extent that you did feel that privacy had changed, you''re now kind of used to anything I put on Facebook gets broadcasted.

So who cares if more randos come in?

It''s already getting broadcasted.

Yep.

Yep.

And now with newsfeed, there is this mechanism that makes sure like, hey, even as randos from your perspective, join Facebook, you''re still seeing the updates of people you care about.

Well, I don''t think at first when And it was this like pure chronology.

Yeah, I guess that''s a good point.

As they make it more algorithmic.

But this was still a period in time where your friends were your friends.

I mean, Facebook was only two years old.

And so for the vast majority of users, they joined in the last year.

So they didn''t have anybody who wasn''t really their friend as a friend.

Now, I just have to treat Facebook posts as if their public because the group of friends is aged.

But in that period of time, you could trust if something was getting published to your friends that like just go on your friends.

Right.

The age of the network itself was only two years.

So your friendships hadn''t shifted that much.

Well, open reds, despite high schools and workplaces not working well, open reds works really well.

Yeah.

I mean, Facebook has a brand at this point.

It''s the best social network.

It''s the fastest growing social network.

It''s the one that all the college kids will always be the cool people in any society at any time.

That''s the age group of trend setting and they have conquered that market.

High school kids want to be like college students and people not in college want to be like college students.

Yep.

So over the summer Facebook was adding like five to 10,000 users a day by late fall after launching open and registration, they''re now adding 70,000 users a day.

Wow, by fall of 06.

Yeah, wow.

Growth really picks up.

So this brings us now to Spring of 07 and the final piece of Mark''s original product roadmap.

I''m bored, aka platform.

And platform is this kind of forgotten thing right now.

I mean, it''s Farmville, it''s Zingha, it''s apps on Facebook.

book.

It''s quizzes.

It''s quizzes, yes.

Welcome back up later.

That''ll come back for a period of about four years from 2007 to 2011.

This is the most important thing in the company.

And this is what everybody believes the core and future of the company is.

Facebook has become a platform.

This is the goal of a technology company.

Become a platform.

Be like Microsoft.

This is now Facebook is like Microsoft.

We are a developer platform.

And there was this incredible tension.

At least it seemed like the tech media wanted to play up this tension.

Are they an advertising company or a platform company?

Because they''re super different business models with very different incentives and users kind of need to know how to think about it.

And it was kind of at the same time Cheryl had just joined the company or was about to join the company the next year in 2008.

So yeah, not yet.

And so they really hadn''t gotten serious.

She sort of led them to figure out, hey, let''s survey all the business models, do some work on each of them and figure out and commit to being an ads company.

At this point in time, like they were showing ads, but the whole leadership team, at least I''m convinced, believed we are on the way to becoming a platform.

a hundred percent.

So May 24th, 2007, Facebook holds its first developer conference to launch their developer platform, F8, which let''s take a step back.

This whole idea is kind of wild.

A developer platform on the web.

The web is a developer platform.

Facebook is now becoming a platform on top of an open developer platform.

But they have two important things that as an application developer, you''re interested in, one, user attention, you know, the same way that Microsoft had user attention with PCs because they had the install base of Windows, and two, a whole crap ton of data about each person that you could then build into your application to make it really rich and feel personalized.

And it turned out that that was really attractive to developers.

So at Effie, They announced that the Facebook user base is now over 20 million and it is growing by over 100,000 users a day.

So growth is accelerating.

Wait, it''s 20 million total and growing by 100,000 a day.

Yes.

I mean, open red had just launched a couple of months before, so like this thing is really taking off.

Oh, my God.

Every 10 days they''re adding another 20th of their user base and they''re growing by five per, what is that?

It''s like 7% every two weeks.

It''s like three and a half percent a week.

Yeah.

Pretty good.

Wow.

At a scale of over 20 million already.

Wow.

It is the sixth highest traffic site in the world and they''re announcing to all the developers in attendance.

The Facebook API, Facebook graph is now open to you.

You can build apps and publish and run them natively on Facebook.

book.

For users and part of Mark''s original product roadmap from 2005, this is huge.

Until this point in time, Facebook was about digitizing everything that happened in your offline life.

Your real friends, your real parties, you went to the real photos you took.

There wasn''t anything detached from your offline reality to do on Facebook.

Now, all of a sudden you can play games on Facebook, you can take quizzes on Facebook, you can use apps on Facebook, and you can do them all with your friends.

It''s pretty compelling.

I remember playing, was it Scrabulous?

Yeah.

I think I was playing with my sister, with my grandma.

I mean, there''s a great way to like do things digitally with the people that matter to you.

Yup.

And I think it''s also an early foreshadowing of the job that mobile and the smartphone would really do in people''s lives, which is, hey, there''s actually like a lot of white space where you''re just bored during your day.

I mean, Mark''s original title of the feature of I''m Board was perfect.

This is the cure for boredom.

It just so happened that it was on a desktop.

And so when you were bored at your desk or bored at your home, mobile then opened that up to like, hey, I''m bored anywhere.

Right.

And it gave Facebook from a business perspective.

It sort of gave them another stakeholder.

Hey, developers are someone who can keep people on the platform longer, so we can show them more ads.

They might do their own advertising, so they might drive traffic to Facebook that they could help grow the core platform itself.

It gives us sort of more lock-in as people develop for us and as users seek out applications on us.

They''re hoping for sort of that Microsoft Playbook of platforms get really epic lock-in.

Yeah.

Oh, and by the way, developers on the platform will probably have their own business models where they''ll make revenue.

And especially if we ultimately introduce our own virtual currency, we can probably make revenue from their revenue too.

Yeah.

So the internal goal of the company was to get 5,000 developers in the first year who would be making social apps on the platform.

I mean, they get, they got 5,000 in two days.

Developers went freaking nuts.

It was a great keynote.

It was a great keynote.

Yes.

You know, they went nuts because yeah, Ben, as you say, like, oh, distribution to a lot of people and then like bringing along your friends and data on them, like that''s very powerful incentive as a developer to then go make an app or a game for the platform.

You''re building a web app that It has an unbelievably rich set of data that you can hook into.

The thing that I was, I don''t think I could have put into words then, but I can now is, has a successful, scale, durable platform ever been built that wasn''t an operating system?

Like, it always felt weird to me in that moment that Facebook thought they could be a platform, because I was like, well, it''s a website.

I mean, it''s a web app.

and I have profile and I have all this rich information, but it''s not like running on my device.

Well, Ben, it turns out you would have been right.

If only I had the words.

But what do you do with that information?

What was I gonna be bearish on the company?

That would have been a super wrong call.

Right, well this is the amazing story that we''re telling here of like they keep surviving and thriving despite not having the operating system.

Yeah, listeners, right in if you can think of one a successful scaled durable platform where the platform is able to make money and they''re able to make a lot of money for developers for people on the platform that is not an operating system that runs on hardware hardware.

either captively controlled hardware like Apple or open hardware like Android and Microsoft.

And this gets into the question of what is a platform because let''s say I make a web app that I run', '2024-10-31 05:21:23', '2024-10-31 05:21:23');

' mean, it''s a web app.

and I have profile and I have all this rich information, but it''s not like running on my device.

Well, Ben, it turns out you would have been right.

If only I had the words.

But what do you do with that information?

What was I gonna be bearish on the company?

That would have been a super wrong call.

Right, well this is the amazing story that we''re telling here of like they keep surviving and thriving despite not having the operating system.

Yeah, listeners, right in if you can think of one a successful scaled durable platform where the platform is able to make money and they''re able to make a lot of money for developers for people on the platform that is not an operating system that runs on hardware hardware.

either captively controlled hardware like Apple or open hardware like Android and Microsoft.

And this gets into the question of what is a platform because let''s say I make a web app that I run on my own website, I do my own marketing, I do my own monetization, but I let users authenticate Facebook so I can pull some information out of their profile.

It''s like it''s not really built on the Facebook platform.

It''s not like the core APIs that enable my application to run are using Facebook''s APIs. I''m using Facebook''s APIs to grab some data.

The core API set that allows it to run is the browser.

Yeah.

It is almost like, if you think about the intermediation layers, Facebook was trying to build a platform on top of a browser that was a platform on top of an operating system that was a platform in it.

The reason why we aren''t all using rich Facebook apps all the time today and think of it as the default platform, it was just too many layers of abstraction away from the hardware to win.

I think that is totally right.

But for the moment, thousands and thousands of both indie devs and venture back companies like flock to the platform.

But what this does tease out is Facebook and now we can talk about this 15 plus years later has kind of a weak position for launching a platform since they don''t control the OS or the hardware and so they have to make a little bit more of an appealing sale to a developer and that includes big distribution for you.

But it also includes a ton of access to data.

And I remember being an early Facebook developer and after user authenticates looking at that JSON and being like, okay, so it''s their whole profile.

Oh, it''s their whole friends list.

Wow, I get a lot of stuff here.

And Facebook was incentivized to do that because they almost had to sell harder than other platforms who controlled hardware historically would have had to.

Yeah, it''s a super great point.

Now also the reality was at the time, I think developers were getting plenty of value just out of the distribution.

And that was coming from newsfeed.

If a user starts using your Facebook app, and then the activity that they''re doing on your app is getting published to the news feeds of all their friends.

Oh, yeah.

You could build a whole zing on that interaction paradigm.

Oh, yes, you can.

There''s this great quote from Josh Elman in the Stephen Levy book.

Just says, if you''re a developer and you can get someone to bother 10 friends to get one more user to join You''re very happy because you just got one more user Facebook though has nine other people who''ve just gotten bothered And he doesn''t say that and are quite unhappy about that.

And that''s the tradeoff They have to weigh that sort of there in the type of platform.

They are trying to build They have set up that incentive set and they need to figure out what to do with it.

Yep So, for a year or two, that is the state of play, Facebook, brilliantly for them, eventually pulls back on organic newsfeed distribution for apps, says, hey, like, we got to stop this, we got to take care of the problem.

You don''t need to know every time there''s a new mafia war move by so and so showing up in your newsfeed.

And that does effectively kill a large percentage of developers and apps on the platform.

Yep.

But it''s the right long-term move.

That was the right thing to do for Facebook with a 20-year view.

Absolutely.

And it doesn''t kill the platform, though.

It actually makes it even more valuable to Facebook because for the developers and apps who have gotten to scale, they kind of look at this and they say, okay, my organic distribution just got kneecapped.

But Facebook is still this pretty powerful platform.

What if I just buy ads?

How well would that work?

Can I generate positive ROI if I buy ads to effectively accomplish the same thing, natively on the platform and drive usage back to my app?

Turns out that there was a very profitable arbitrage there still for many years to come.

And for Facebook, they''re like, well, hell yeah.

Okay, we''re monetizing the platform through user engagement and ads that we''re showing on the right rail while people are using Facebook apps.

We are also monetizing through currency and commerce that is happening in the apps where we''re taking a cut of that through payments.

Now we''re gonna monetize platform in a third way, which is the biggest scale developers and app distributors on the platform are going to use our native advertising as their primary form of distribution.

I mean, you can see why for a couple of years here, Facebook is like, well, this is it.

We''ve won, you know, we are a platform, this is it.

Yep.

And then mobile comes along.

Oh, mobile.

That is quite the chapter in the Facebook story.

but before we do that, now is a great time to tell you about one of our favorite companies, the Climate Aligned AI Infrastructure Company, Crusoe.

Yes, Crusoe is a vertically integrated cloud platform built specifically for AI workloads that was recently named the gold standard of AI cloud providers by Dylan Patel over at semi-analysis.

And something that''s new and really cool since we started working with Crusoe last year, they''ve opened up the raw metal in their data centers to customers.

So let''s say you''re a large enterprise who wants to run your own infrastructure and not use a cloud layer, you could actually now do that with Crusoe directly as a data center customer, which several of the largest companies in the world are now doing.

Yep, they''ve totally reimagined traditional data center architecture to support the huge power cooling and compute density needs of AI.

Yep, that''s important because power demand in GPUs is increasing dramatically, which means the traditional data center design and engineering of the hyperscalers is no longer optimal.

So Crusoe''s infrastructure built from the ground up for GPUs with elements like high density racks, direct liquid to chip cooling, that enables them to support the most demanding AI workloads that traditional data centers just can''t handle.

And at the same time, as GPU cluster sizes continue to increase, there''s an ever increasing demand for energy.

Crusoe has 15 gigawatts in its development pipeline, which is an astronomical amount of power.

Their Abilene Texas facility alone has over 1.2 gigawatts planned, which will make it one of the largest clusters in the world.

Yep, and it''s also not just about the amount of capacity in the pipeline, it''s about how fast it can come online.

Crusoe''s team has decades of experience constructing and operating data centers, which enables them to bring these new data centers online super fast.

First, as many of you already know, Crusoe sources the energy for these data centers in the most efficient and climate aligned way in the entire industry, through clean, low-cost and abundant energy that otherwise goes to waste.

For example, in oil fields where natural gas is flared, in congested parts of the grid where renewable power is curtailed, or other areas where energy is stranded.

Which actually accomplishing that is a crazy hard thing.

Crusoe''s energy first approach means they can build data centers in some of the most challenging locations on Earth, bringing computing to the energy rather than the other way around.

Yep.

The net of all of this is that Crusoe can provide nuclear levels of power for far less cost than other providers and with low or in some cases actually negative emissions.

And that''s super important because the biggest bottleneck to AI progress is actually energy.

It''s not compute.

Yeah.

Anyway, they''re just a great company.

We''re super proud to work with them and to be investors.

To learn more about Crucio, you can go to crucio.ai slash acquired.

That''s CRUSOE.ai slash acquired.

Or click the link in the show notes and just tell them that Ben and David sent you.

Thanks, Crucio.

All right, so David, we''re here in the era of mobile, right?

This is January 2007, Steve Jobs just announced the iPhone.

The whole world changed, right?

Well, actually ironically, no, or at least not for quite a while.

Yes, January 2007, Steve Jobs announces the iPhone.

People forget though, it took five years for mobile and smartphone adoption to really ramp up and like actually changed the world.

There was no SDK in that first iPhone in iOS that didn''t come till 2008.

It was $700.

Android was a Blackberry clone at the time, not an iPhone clone.

and the droid does campaign wouldn''t be another year or two.

Yeah, I think two years.

I think that was 2009, if I remember right.

Yeah.

So yeah, I mean, hell, Facebook platform didn''t even launch until May 2007, so after the iPhone announcement.

Yep.

So for the moment, platform is rockin'' and rollin''.

Like we were just talking about, Facebook is becoming the next Microsoft, which brings us to the second Microsoft partnership in October of 2007.

So just five months after F8 and platform launch, Facebook now has like all of the leverage.

Dan Rose has some great stories on Twitter about how this negotiation goes down.

Oh yeah, you spent time with Dan, didn''t you prepping for this?

Yep, and I chatted with Dan about this.

This is great.

So Microsoft, perhaps obvious now in retrospect to everybody, really just wants to buy the company, but Mark''s of course not going to do that after the whole Yahoo experience, etc.

Microsoft is also happy, though, to just keep the partnership going and expand it.

Because one, it is really helping them spin up their online services division and get really good at online ad sales and ad serving.

And two, they know they made a huge error in missing search and letting Google get big.

And social sure seems like it''s going to be the next search size platform.

So they''re happy to just be in bed with Facebook in a way that they never will be with Google.

As long as they can keep it going, I mean, for them, I think the thing that shocked them about Google is, oh my God, the business model of the web is advertising.

Search and browsers and everything are monetized by advertising and that''s completely orthogonal to our traditional license-based business model.

Social sure looks like where all the page views are going and is going to monetize exactly the same way as search.

So actually the thing that''s important to them is locking in those page views to the extent that they can participate in this market.

It kind of has to be either we own you or we are the long-term ad provider, which they didn''t end up being or were a big equity holder.

Yeah, so enter this second partnership negotiation.

October 2007, Microsoft comes down to Palo Alto.

Facebook tells them that hey, Google is actually really interested in taking this partnership over.

Larry and Sergei have been banging down the door and we''ve been trying to hold them off, but they''re coming to meet with us tomorrow to talk about switching our Facebook ad serving partnership over to Google.

And this has been great.

We love working with y''all.

You are our preference, our preferred partner.

We want to keep it going with you, but we need to get the deal done ten night.

So they lock themselves all in the conference room.

They start negotiating.

It''s getting late, 10 o''clock goes by 11 o''clock.

The Microsoft team, you know, by Facebook standards is all old guys, like they''re getting tired.

And then, you know, old guys, like, you know, 40.

Like, oh, it''s so old.

And then at midnight, this is amazing.

You can''t make this up.

Facebook probably planned this.

All of a sudden, this really loud, like house music starts blaring, like with like heavy bass in the office.

And the office is hopping, like everybody''s there, the whole company''s there, it''s midnight.

The Microsoft guys, like, what''s going on?

And the Facebook, you know, it''s like, oh yeah.

We have a hackathon schedule tonight.

And actually, Javier Olivan had just started at Facebook, who''s now COO.

Who is now the COO of meta had just started at Facebook as an engineer.

And he had organized this hackathon to begin work on internationalizing the site.

So tonight is the beginning of internationalization, which is a critical, critical part of Facebook''s next chapter of growth.

Yes.

And it is beginning at the same time that this Microsoft partnership is happening in a conference room.

And didn''t this Microsoft deal will end up being about international?

Yes.

Yes it did.

So they keep going at one point during the night, one of the Microsoft guys, according to Dan, Lixit Hinton says, wow, this is awesome.

This is just like the old days of Microsoft.

So they finished the negotiation at 6am.

They announced the new partnership that very same day as promised with the threat of Google.

Microsoft becomes the worldwide exclusive third-party advertising network for all display ads on Facebook.

So it was domestic in the US before.

Now it''s international to and domestic everywhere around the world.

Facebook, of course, can still also sell their own inventory themselves, but anything that they don''t want to sell themselves or that is excess inventory, Microsoft gets exclusive access to be the only ad network where you can access it.

And the big kicker, Microsoft is going to invest $240 million in Facebook at a $15 billion valuation.

This is like 13 or 14 months after the failed Yahoo deal for $1 billion.

That is the thing that no one talks about here.

I''m so glad you brought this up because before they started this negotiation, the attempt was to buy Facebook.

The highest offer floated.

We talked about this in the Microsoft episode.

It was a complicated set of yield terms that basically netted out to a $24 billion offer.

And that was less than two years after the $1 billion offer that everyone talks about with Yahoo.

Oh, remember the time where Mark Zuckerberg turned down a billion dollars?

Less than two years later, he turned down 24 billion and that they were really good for the money.

It''s Microsoft.

But turned it around into an investment at 15 billion.

Yeah, it''s crazy.

So, the great thing is like all great partnerships, everyone makes out wonderfully here.

Except maybe the venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, because this just like breaks everyone''s brain.

It was the high watermark for Facebook''s valuation for a while, because the great financial crisis would happen after those valuations would all reset, and then Facebook''s next deal would get done.

I think with Yuri Milner at 10 billion?

10 billion dollar valuation with Yuri.

Yep.

And Yuri would actually also buy common stock through a secondary tender offer in that.

So his dollar cost average would get down to more like six.

So he got a scream and deal.

But for the moment, there are no comps to this ever.

Dotcom bubble, you name it, like never has been a comp like this for an investment in a private technology startup.

The closest comp that I can even sort of think of was Google''s market cap at IPO was 23 billion.

So like higher, but not that much higher.

And Google at IPO was a $2 billion revenue run rate spitting off hundreds of millions of dollars in free cash flow annually.

Facebook at this point in time is basically break even and doing 150 million in revenue, most of which is Microsoft itself.

All that said, Microsoft, Microsoft, this is a home-freaking run, like we''ve been saying all along, helps them spin up Bing, doing all the ad-serving for this, getting in like real online services, and then being, Microsoft is not a hedge fund, as we talked about on that episode, but that $240 million investment.

By the time they start selling it down, years after Facebook is public, ends up being worth $8 billion.

dollars.

Wow.

And then maybe the most important benefit to Microsoft out of all of this is like Microsoft and Facebook have always had a good relationship.

Unlike Microsoft has with Google and Apple.

I remember Facebook events like when you look at the page, it was a Bing map, not a Google map that always like felt emblematic of the partnership to me.

Yeah.

Every single place it could be a Microsoft product it was.

Yes, and it wasn''t a Google product.

Yep.

Okay, so interestingly, here we are 2007, Facebook is still saying we don''t need to be in control of the core revenue creator for us.

Like we think platform is the future, Microsoft, you''re our preferred partner to handle making the money.

Yes, and I think, you know, there''s two things here.

Yes, I think that is true specifically at this moment in time, but this is where, you know, kind of like calling it all the way back to civilization and the Forex strategy game.

He''s got multiple bets he''s placing on the chessboard.

One, as you said, is like platform.

Like, hey, platform is rocking and rolling.

We think we''re building the next great technology company and the next great business model just on platform.

Also, yeah, we''re a social media company that involves a lot of page views and engagement and like the right way to monetize that is advertising.

So yes, we''ve just continued this big Microsoft partnership.

But we have the right to sell our own inventory and we should probably start building that muscle too.

The other thing that''s happening here is Mark still kind of thought ads were gross at this point in history.

So the things he cared about were product and engineering and design and he kind of wanted to outsource everything else or at least have someone else at the company think about it.

And having Microsoft take care of the ads was I think in his mind kind of a win-win.

That way the commodity stuff can happen elsewhere and I can focus on the thing that really matters.

And the company really did not have the insight yet.

Oh, we can do ads different and better than anyone has ever done them before.

Well, I''m smiling as you''re saying that because in practice for this moment, yeah.

In reality, they were trying to build their own native Facebook advertising unit, so to speak.

It was just beacon.

Yeah, beacon is one of the most epic failures in Facebook''s whole history.

Yeah.

Okay, so beacon.

Well, first off, you were totally right, and I think you were foreshadowing Sheryl Sandberg there of like Mark wants somebody within the company to just, you know, run and manage this thing and build it, great world class.

Before Sheryl, do you know which Facebook executive led Beacon?

I do not.

Jamoth Polly Hoppattia.

No way.

He always talks about the growth he I never knew he was in charge of Beacon first.

This was Jamoth''s big thing before growth.

And actually the epic failure here of beacon leads directly to growth as we shall see in a second.

Now, what was beacon?

So like he said, Mark is kind of allergic to traditional advertising.

But he''s like, well, we have this incredible social activity happening on Facebook.

And we know through newsfeed that people engage with and they love it.

What if they were a way for a native ad baked into the very fabric of the product itself that brands could sort of control and monetize.

Well, if we gave brands a way to essentially boost how people are already engaging with them, that might be the way to do this.

And what this ends up being in practice is brands publishing your friend''s e-commerce activity into your newsfeed.

Now, to be fair to Mark and Jamath and the company, we didn''t know yet what the right advertising unit on Facebook was gonna be.

And this is probably as good an idea as any because like the core thing that you do on Facebook is you engage with your friends and you engage with their stories on newsfeed.

And there''s kind of no evidence really that people would want to do anything else but that.

And so you''re trying to kind of think of like, how do we shoehorn advertising in brands into this?

I actually, I don''t buy it at all.

The obvious thing is show an image that people can click on and take them to a website.

It''s display ads and like, I don''t understand why they needed to try to way overthink it and say our ad format has to be something that no one''s ever thought of before.

Like just offer advertisers to do the thing that they know how to buy.

Well, I was trying to like think of how to be the most charitable possible to the company and how they can come up with it.

But yeah, I have next in my notes here to be clear.

This was a truly, truly terrible head up your rear end idea.

These are actually two different things I think.

There was Beacon, which was JavaScript that an advertiser could embed on their website, on an e-commerce provider''s website, that would do exactly what you''re talking about.

Publish into the newsfeed purchases that people were making.

And like, this was at the point where you wanted to publish all sorts of interesting different things on social media.

I don''t think we knew for sure that purchases wasn''t gonna be one of them.

Like people still keep their Venmo history public.

You don''t know what people are gonna do.

The second thing that I think is in your description there a little bit is the idea of social ads that brands could take interactions that happen on pages and boost them, but they couldn''t just take out a regular old ad.

So it was this weird thing where like you could only advertise as a brand to people where someone in their network had interacted with your brand page.

Yeah.

Pretty convoluted.

I get that it''s like this super natively social thing.

But again, it did feel like they started in this place where they''re like, let''s get way too clever for our own good first and then work backward to the most basic ad unit.

Yeah.

Totally agree.

That said, like as soon as it''s live, it becomes clear, like one nobody wants this, either of these things.

Yeah.

Users don''t want it.

Users are confused why they''re seeing.

I mean, certainly there''s instant blowback against their publishing my purchases.

Someone I think had an engagement spoiled by a diamond ring getting broadcast.

Yes.

Oh, yeah.

I was going to say, I mean, this is number two.

Like, the privacy implications here actually are like horrific, like, spoiling engagements.

Like, that''s the wholesome, horrific privacy things.

Like, you can imagine the non-wholesome publishing stuff that you''re buying versions of this.

Yep.

And then, of course, advertisers are confused and people don''t really understand what''s an ad, what''s not an ad.

They just burned credibility everywhere by launching both of these things.

Yep, totally.

And Mark and the company is coming off the newsfeed experience where they''re like, yeah, if we just give it enough time, users will get used to it.

So they let it run for a couple weeks.

They run the newsfeed playbook of like, yeah, yeah, we hear you, but you''ll get used to it.

and here''s some more controls.

Oh, the social ads was years and years, but the purchase is you''re right.

That was just, I think, a couple of weeks.

Yeah, for Beacon.

Ultimately, after a few weeks, they do acquiesce and they say, okay, we will turn Beacon off, we''ll make it opt in as opposed to opt out.

And you can have a way to completely turn off all Beacon tracking permanently from your profile.

A lot of people do that.

Beacon activity basically drops to zero and then, yeah, two years later, it''s like completely killed off.

And this sets the stage for Cheryl joining the company, because I think, you know, Mark''s take away from this is like, okay, maybe I don''t understand dedo advertising as well as I thought I did.

Like I thought I didn''t like it, but I thought I could be clever and engineer this new thing and like, actually let''s bring in somebody who like really, really does understand this.

And Cheryl was the perfect person coming from Google, Cheryl joined Google in 2001, right as they were figuring out ad words.

I mean, that''s like three years after the company was founded.

Totally.

And the company didn''t figure out ad words for a couple of years.

So it was like, that was like the key moment.

And then Cheryl built and ran the whole self-serve business at Google, which was the most important and the most technology like enabled part of what they were doing.

She had built the greatest digital advertising system in the world, and Mark was like, oh, I''m trying to build the greatest digital advertising system in the world.

Who could I ever get to do that with me?

And wouldn''t it be great if that person was also a good manager and leader who could teach me how to manage and lead?

Yes.

Yes.

And I think that really is the quote unquote deal they make.

And they say, and you know, Cheryl agrees too.

So it''s not like, hey, Mark said like, you''re gonna take this side of the company and I''m gonna take that side of the company.

She always reported to him like the whole company was his company, but Mark is really focused on product, engineering, and importantly, platform.

Cheryl takes ads, Cheryl takes operations, et cetera.

And when she comes on board, like you referenced this earlier, Ben, there''s basically no ad targeting that''s happening natively on Facebook.

They''re probably is targeting that''s happening through the third party Microsoft advertising network.

But none of that is like technology that Facebook''s building or value that''s accruing to Facebook.

And so the first thing Mark and Cheryl did when she joined was like, OK, beacon was such a disaster.

We''ve got this great partnership with Microsoft.

Like let''s just do a full exploration.

Should we be in the ads business at all?

Yeah, she definitely famously kind of led the exploration of what business are we actually in here?

Yeah.

And, you know, ultimately, they decide, yes, we are in a media business, thus we should be in the advertising business, and we should do it right, and we should make it work.

And, ultimately, that is going to be building a really, really, really great targeting engine, which is the thing that Facebook is, like, uniquely capable of doing.

Yeah.

So, though, back to here where we are in 2008 to seemingly unrelated, but about to get very related things are going on.

One, after the beacon fiasco when Cheryl joined, Chamoth kind of needs a new job at the company.

Like total credit to Mark, to Cheryl, to Facebook as a company.

I think at most places, like, Chamoth would have been fired immediately for what happened with beacon.

But the culture at Facebook is like, nope, we move fast, we break things and we''re always on offense and this didn''t work and let''s find the right thing for you to do and thank goodness because that brings us to number two right around this time once again user growth slows at Facebook.

Yeah, so it''s funny that I don''t feel like in the public eye we really knew these things, but as you kind of dig into the company history, you''re like, oh, there are these moments in time growth really did stall out.

And, you know, Chamoth has said on stage since then, oh, I totally thought that growth was done.

And there''s a few things to note about the growth team.

One is, it was effectively the first growth team.

Yes.

I think it was the first growth team.

Yeah.

Everyone who wants to get into growth now, I don''t think really fully grasps.

That is a brand new discipline invented in 2008.

And the way they sort of defined it at Facebook was, There''s marketing, there''s product, but marketing and product both touch customers in different ways and so the left hand needs to talk to the right hand.

So for example, you should not have a marketing team that is sending out emails through an email marketing system and a product team that is sending out notifications to users through the product with no notion of how they''re speaking to each other.

where you should A, unify those efforts through one team, and B, that team should live within product, or at least that team should be tightly coupled to product with the general belief or reason for being that your product is the best lever to grow.

No amount of marketing you could ever throw at something that is not integrated into your product will be as effective as your product doing a good job with features, hitting the right users with the right message and the right value at the right time in a native way to the core feature set of the product.

And so you''ve got Shamath, you''ve got Alex Schultz, you''ve got Naomi Glyte and Javier Olivan.

And so you''ve got this core early team.

It''s four people and then it expands to kind of six or seven folks that are formed really on this agreement between Shamath and Mark of, we''re going to have this dedicated growth team and our mission is going to be to grow Facebook using Facebook itself, not through extrinsic measures.

Yep.

And this was like an incredible insight and was so perfect for Facebook because I think this growth insight of growth through product can apply to any company, but it especially applies to a virally growing social network like Facebook.

Yes.

There''s interesting things that make it tick.

The first of which is this has to be the most data-obsessed team in the company.

Every team should be data-obsessed, but like the growth team is really the one who sort of discovers, oh, here are the obvious places where users are or deriving value, here are the obvious places where users are getting confused, here are the obvious opportunities to find new users, here are the obvious opportunities to reduce friction, analytics is the answer for that.

And I think that there''s a lot of really interesting stories especially around internationalization of the growth team and partnering with other product teams around the company to say, what is an engineering and product approach to something that traditionally has been done other ways?

Like, the way most people would translate their product is by hiring translation, servicing firms or by hiring a dedicated person to go through string by string and edit, well, we''re Facebook.

We have all these users.

What if we just, you know, when we''re launching in Spain, surface different words to Spanish speakers and say, okay, is this the right word for Spanish or not?

Hey, can you translate this and crowdsource it and double check it with everyone?

And that way, you can not just translate five or 10 of the top languages in the world.

You can be in every language all the time up to date using Facebook itself because, oh, by the way, when you translate the product, way more people can use it.

And so translation itself, internationalization is a growth lever and we have product ways to do the translation with our users.

Yep.

And that''s what actually started even before the official growth team with Havi and that first hackathon.

Yes.

But that was the seed of this idea of like, oh, actually, the way to get past this growth wall as people Refer to it in retrospect that we''re hitting is use the product itself and internationalization.

There''s even more to it than what you said one When you have the users themselves who are translating a product as you''re seeding it in these new markets It''s there so much more bought in and like feel a sense of ownership over it versus like, oh, I''m just air dropping this, you know, translated American product onto your country here.

So it''s not just that it''s a better translation.

It''s that like you''re actually seeding those first power users who are gonna be deeply engaged and feel ownership over the product.

Yeah.

And then too, the nuance in like this local markets that might even be in the same language.

I mean, Spanish is the perfect example.

Spanish is spoken in so many places around the world, but like the local nuances and needs in Spain are like super different than Mexico, or Argentina, or Latin America, et cetera.

That''s exactly right.

And I think my point with all of this is A, growth is a pretty new discipline in our industry.

Two, growth is not marketing.

It''s very tempting.

You see, especially with incumbents, like big Fortune 500 companies who have someone who''s title as growth and then you ask them what they do and you''re like, oh, no, that''s not growth.

That''s marketing.

You don''t actually modify the product at all.

So that''s a different thing.

And it''s important to realize, like, not only did Facebook kind of invent the discipline, they are perhaps still the best at it.

They really eat, sleep, and breathe the idea that growth comes from product.

Yeah.

It was that core initial team, all of them, of which Havi, Havi''s now the COO.

Alex, Alex is now the CMO of Meta.

Naomi, Naomi is now Meta''s longest tenured employee besides Mark and runs a ton of stuff at the company.

And Shamath who deserves so much credit for starting the team, pulling it together, protecting it, advocating for it within the rest of product in the way that only Shamath can.

Man, it really is crazy with the Facebook diaspora.

We''re going to keep seeing this as we go along.

There''s other names where people will be like, whoa, I didn''t realize they were at Facebook, but many of the names that have come up so far, yeah, the diaspora is pretty talented.

Yep.

So there were a million things that growth did over the years within, you know, the blue app and then ultimately within all the apps at Facebook.

Growth today is a core center of excellence discipline that spreads across all the products at the company at Meta.

But the other big thing in the early days besides internationalization is people you may know, which crazy, like the carousel of people you may know on Facebook is still a core part of the blue app to this day.

Dude, I just got lost in it.

Did you know that that''s what I was looking at right now?

No. I was sanity checking.

I was like, oh, is that person part of the original growth team?

And I opened Facebook.

The newsfeed distracted me.

I scrolled down the stories at the top.

I scrolled down one post below that first post was an ad.

Below that is people you may know.

And I am like three panels over in people you may know because I was like, oh my gosh, I''m not friends with them.

We''re doing a podcast together live.

and I just had that experience.

Totally.

People you may know become such an important lever.

And I love it.

I love it.

Okay.

So people you may know become such an important lever.

Yes.

For a whole bunch of reasons.

The growth team discovers you were talking about analytics and data and really understanding what''s happening.

The key thing that they discover for new years who''s joining Facebook about whether they become an engaged, active, you know, evangelizing user or not, is how many friends they get in the first, like, I think it''s 24 hours or 48 hours, like short period that they''re joining the network.

And there''s like a certain number of active friends that you need.

Oh, this is funny, by the way.

I watch two different talks by people on the early growth team.

And one of them cited 10 friends in 14 days, the other cited seven friends in 10 days of, you know, how do you create the magic moment?

Alex Schultz, who''s now the CMO, gives this great talk, gosh, a decade ago at startup school with Sam Altman.

And he makes a point, look, it''s kind of a linear thing.

Yes, you want as many friends as possible in the least amount of time.

It''s not like, oh, magically at 10 friends in 14 days, it''s like super different than nine friends in 14 days.

But you just set a threshold somewhere and you set the threshold and then you''re like, okay, if we can deliver this delightful experience where now people have a rich news feed and the people they care the most about in the world to interact with, they''re going to retain.

Yep, totally.

The other thing is it marries perfectly with all of the investment that is going into the algorithmicization of news feed because choosing who to show you in that carousel of people you may know is like all the difference in the world, you know, show you seven randos and like you''re going to turn, show you your seven best friends and you''re going to friend them all and become an engaged user.

I''m so excited for I guarantee you at least one of the people that I just friended is going to be listening to this podcast and realize what just happened because I haven''t friended anyone on Facebook in years and I just sent out like three or four.

They just reengaged you as a user.

I love it.

Yes, they just have to new growth tactic have people do podcasts about the company and then.

I think people cut onto that one a while ago.

Yes, but yeah, like that''s a super hard data problem of like cold new user coming into the network.

How are you going to accurately predict who their best friends are who are already on Facebook?

Well, if you''re on the web and this is the late 2000s, you ask them to authenticate their web-based mail service of choice and then find out who they''ve been emailing and then use that to figure out who their friends are.

Magic.

Magic.

Oh, you know, there''s other less nefarious ways, you know, see who has sent them links in the past, who are also logged in Facebook users.

'ended anyone on Facebook in years and I just sent out like three or four.

They just reengaged you as a user.

I love it.

Yes, they just have to new growth tactic have people do podcasts about the company and then.

I think people cut onto that one a while ago.

Yes, but yeah, like that''s a super hard data problem of like cold new user coming into the network.

How are you going to accurately predict who their best friends are who are already on Facebook?

Well, if you''re on the web and this is the late 2000s, you ask them to authenticate their web-based mail service of choice and then find out who they''ve been emailing and then use that to figure out who their friends are.

Magic.

Magic.

Oh, you know, there''s other less nefarious ways, you know, see who has sent them links in the past, who are also logged in Facebook users.

There''s all sorts of stuff you can do, but yes.

So by the end of 2008, thanks to the growth team.

Growth is like really going again.

They go from just barely getting to 100 million users in August of 2008 to almost 150 million by the end of the year.

So 50% growth in the last four months of the year.

And then 2009 is just like lights out.

They grow 250% in 2009 to 350 million users globally.

Internationalization and is like really firing on all cylinders here.

That''s right, they went from 150 million users to 350 million.

No, in like one year, isn''t that wild?

Crazy.

The other core piece of the stat whenever you''re looking at growth, this will look at engagement.

Engagement in 2008 was also in the doldrums.

50% of monthly actives were daily actives.

And from what I can tell, that basically was just an artifact of, as the company got bigger, Every marginal user they added was sort of less engaged than the early core users, you know, when they went from colleges to high schools to open registration, it just was going to have slightly less product market fit.

But growth team is focused not just on growing new users, actually an even better lever.

Every long-term goal is retaining your existing users, and the best lever for retention is engagement.

And so that was where a huge amount of their energy went.

So this is really interesting.

50% of monthly actives were daily actives in O8.

Since then, they have basically improved that metric every year.

There''s been a little bit of variance, but it is now almost 70% today.

Been a maniacal focus on how do we make as many monthly actives daily actives as possible, year over year over year over year.

That''s wild.

And that figure is just in the blue app in Facebook.

that is just in the blue app, yep, exactly.

Wow.

Well, on the engagement front in 2009, the big thing that happens there is like button.

You know where I''m going with this, like button.

Yep.

And I know you know who invented the like button.

Cause it wasn''t Facebook.

I don''t know.

Friend feed.

Oh, no way.

Brett Taylor and Paul Bukay invented the like button.

How did that work?

Because FriendFeed would just federate stories from other social networks into one aggregated feed.

Yep.

I don''t recall exactly.

Did it only store that information on FriendFeed and not propagate it back?

I suspect that''s probably it.

Like they probably felt like they needed some sort of, like, hey, native mechanic on FriendFeed.

Man, FriendFeed was so awesome.

It''s funny in this era where I''m now checking multiple feeds every day, Twitter, threads, Instagram, all the messaging services to catch up on my messages, occasionally the blue app.

I kind of need friend feed again.

That was like the most amazing product.

I know.

I know.

The world is so vulcanized, it''ll never happen.

But yeah, I mean, talk about another amazing part of the Facebook diaspora, Facebook with later acquire friend feed, Brett Taylor would become.

CTO, when Adam Dantleau left to go start Cora, and then when Facebook acquired friend feed, Brett became CTO.

And then famously Brett becomes the co-president of Salesforce by way of acquisition, and then eventually board chair at Twitter when the whole X thing was going on, and now he''s on the board at OpenAI.

Yep, board chair, I think at OpenAI.

Crazy.

Andy''s got a new start above his own, so I''m telling you, the talent that moved through that place.

Well, and Paul Buckeye, the other friend feed founder invented Gmail created Gmail within Google.

Yeah.

So he ended up at Facebook for a while then after I forgot about Paul too.

It''s unbelievable.

Yeah, he must not have stayed very long if at all.

Yeah.

Because he went to YC I think after that.

Okay, so friend feed invents the like button.

Facebook I believe was going to call it the awesome button.

And then at some point, right before launching, I think Mark personally made the call, it''s just too weird.

Let''s go with like, yes.

The story as I understand it is that Facebook had been considering something like this for a long time.

I mean, the benefits are obvious, right?

Like if you have a lightweight way to engage and feed more data about positive votes on and posts into the newsfeed algorithm, like that''s gonna really turbocharge things.

On the flip side, the concern was that it would actually decrease meaningful engagement.

There''d be less comments.

Exactly.

And so ultimately, they started running some tests with like small user groups and specific geographies, and they found that it actually often boosted engagement of comments.

Fascinating.

That''s why you test things, you never know.

Exactly.

So yes, they launched the like button and that becomes huge for overall engagement, But also, more importantly, for just improving the algorithm, which is now starting to kick in and newsfeed and making sure you''re seeing stories that you really care about.

And the like button then also got used for pages.

And it became this sort of form of capital among brands of how many Facebook likes does your company have, which for a while actually meant you could organically get messages out to them.

every time you posted it was as if a company was a person and you just show up in the feed before Facebook ultimately was like, those are advertisements, you''re going to pay us for those.

Yes, you''re exactly on the right track.

Let''s flip back now to Cheryl and building the advertising business right around the same time we''ve decided like, okay, yes, we''re going to be in the advertising business and to do that right, to do that natively, to do that in a way that generates defensible, sustainable value for Facebook.

That means targeting.

And the like button is the perfect gift to this.

Because all of a sudden there''s this really lightweight way to engage with things to signal your preferences about what you like.

Yep.

And the like button ended up being the perfect Trojan horse to move Facebook platform form off of Facebook.

So there was a reason for third party websites to embed Facebook''s JavaScript in their pages.

Because of course, you''d want to be able to like an article or like a brand all up on their website.

You know, how many Facebook likes do you have?

If that''s what matters, we want people clicking like on our website too, not just over on Facebook.

And so suddenly now every company on earth has some Facebook and has a reason to embed some Facebook JavaScript right there on their page, which my goodness, that''s going to serve as a great signal back to the advertising algorithm where we can drop cookies and we can see who is moving around the web in what ways.

So it''s perfect for platform, but it''s also perfect for feeding data into their advertising system.

Now that they have something that brands and third party websites are incentivized to drop right on their page.

Yes.

apps are freaking lootly.

So we talked about growth reigniting at the end of 2008 into 2009.

The business is also on fire in 2009 in a good way.

So platform still rocking and rolling, Microsoft display ad partnership still growing strong as growth is happening.

Now under Cheryl, you finally got real native, highly targeted ads coming online in Facebook.

But in 2008, the company had done 280 million in revenue up from 153 the year before in 2007.

2009, they do almost 800 million in revenue.

He''s crushing it.

2010, an even two billion in revenue.

They''re now very, very cash flow positive.

Yes, reaching the scale that Google was at their IPO.

So 2010, they hit 600 million users, 2011, 850 million users, 2011 revenue grows almost to another 100% to 3.7 billion.

It''s like, all right, time to start thinking about taking this company public.

It''s also time to start thinking about what is our biggest existential threat.

It''s so funny that we''re talking about.

And the existential threats are over.

We''ve won.

We have platform going well, we have this advertising business going well, we''re getting data from the open web because we have like buttons everywhere, everything is going our way.

We finally have it dialed and none of that matters in a mobile world as people shift from spending time on the web to other apps that open web data used as signal goes away.

All of your ability to take payments, by the way, Facebook had launched payments.

At some point, they started requiring apps to use their virtual currency.

Facebook credits.

Facebook credits.

That''s right.

All of these amazing pillars that they''ve built were for the open web and created the most incredible business-known demand and mobile is a completely different thing.

Yep.

That seed from five years ago that has been growing a mobile is finally going to turn into a big big big problem for the company.

All right, so let''s just get into it.

I thought it would be fun.

I listed out all of the ways that I could think of that mobile was a big problem for Facebook.

One, and I think this is kind of like the Uber problem that everything else is downstream of.

iOS and Android are closed proprietary ecosystems not controlled by Facebook.

Yeah, you can argue Android is open source and all that, but for all intents and purposes, Google controls it and they control the play store.

Put another way.

The web is the only open platform in history.

Yes.

And Facebook was born on the web.

I mean, how crazy is it that they could build Facebook on entirely free technologies at the beginning and then get distribution just by people sharing you are else around, browsers are interchangeable, operating systems are interchangeable, it works on any device that anyone wants.

Yeah.

If you live on the web, you have infinite degrees of freedom and flexibility to control your own destiny.

Yeah.

And Facebook had kind of built this, you know, walled garden on the web and it was pretty nice.

Yep.

And walled gardens are great as long as the foundation under you can''t shift.

Yes.

Build your walled garden directly on the earth, not on someone else''s foundation.

But okay, specifically, why is iOS and Android being closed proprietary ecosystem such a problem?

That means my number two reason, platform, which is 50% or more of the value of Facebook in their minds at this point in time, no longer works at all.

Like, full stop, flip a switch, does not work, will never work at all ever again on these platforms.

And why is that the whole premise of platform is you can run apps inside of Facebook On mobile you will never be able to run an app inside another app Just not gonna happen.

Apple''s never gonna let it happen and Google''s never gonna let it happen And that''s primarily because of that thing around you can''t launch an alternative app store Right.

Yeah, I mean, it''s the core part of their business model are the apps Not to mention if you are paying for things on their phone you have to use their payment system.

So Facebook credits ain''t going to work because you can''t charge 30% on top of 30%.

Yeah, and there''s technical aspects to this too, right?

Like code runs in native code on these devices as opposed to open HTML on the web.

Right, you get told what your development environment is.

This is the language.

These are the frameworks.

These are the APIs you''re allowed to call.

Yep.

So, okay, greater than 50% of, you know, the revenue and the sort of like...

theoretical future value.

inherent theoretical value and strategy of the business.

Necap it gets worse.

Facebook and Mark and Cheryl have been hard at work building the other core pillar of the business.

This new super sexy targeted ads business.

Well, guess what?

All of the ads that are running on Facebook at this point in time are running on the right-hand column on the website.

There is no right hand column on a mobile app.

There''s only room for a feed, which to this point in time has never had advertising in it.

And in fact, there''s like a cultural allergy to the idea of polluting the beautiful pristine organic news feed with an ad.

We don''t require big cultural change.

This is why you can''t make up this stuff in these stories that we tell.

Facebook has, Because I kid you not no way to make money at all on mobile.

Here is an actual honest to God statement that is in Facebook''s S1 that they filed before the IPO in 2012.

I am reading as a quote, we had more than 425 million monthly active users who used Facebook mobile products in December 2011.

We anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile users will continue to exceed the growth rate of our overall MAUs for the foreseeable future and our users could decide to increasingly access our products primarily through mobile devices.

Which let''s be clear, comparing those growth rates, another way to simplify that and say it is our user base is shifting to mobile from desktop.

Another way to simplify that is our desktop business is going to zero.

Yes.

Now, the kicker.

This is a statement in the S1.

We do not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue from the use of Facebook mobile products and our ability to do so successfully is unproven.

Accordingly, by our stock.

Yeah.

Accordingly, if users continue to increasingly access Facebook mobile products as a substitute for access to personal computers, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our mobile users, our revenue and financial results may be negatively impacted.

Yeah.

No kidding.

Oh my God.

I''m still not done.

That''s only reason number three.

Okay.

Reason number four.

Another benefit of the open web is that you can push code whenever you want.

You can make changes rapidly.

You can move fast.

You can break things and then you can fix them rapidly.

This is how Facebook has always operated.

On mobile apps, you can push code when Apple and Google tell you that you can push code.

And at this point in time, there was approximately a two-week delay between pushing an update and it being reviewed and accepted.

Not only was there a two-week delay, during that two weeks, Apple and Google are reviewing and if they see anything that they don''t like for whatever reason they are telling you, no, you cannot push that code.

Or your company could be in a fight with that company and they could decide, ah, I don''t think you should push any updates for a while until we resolve our fight.

Yep.

Okay, so that''s number four and then that brings me to number five reason that I could think of of why this is really bad for Facebook.

The competitive field is about to get a total reset.

On the web, Facebook is dominant.

Network effects are super real.

Everything we talked about in this whole first part of the episode, if they can suck up all of the new social functionality that that they are anyone else in vents, they can put it into the main Facebook app, photos, chat, platform, newsfeed, et cetera.

On mobile though, Facebook is just one icon of many on the home screen.

Exactly.

And the wisdom at the time was that mobile apps should be narrow in their functionality, and you did not expect a single app to bundle in a ton of different use cases.

It''s super easy for users to be like, hmm, okay, I get this utility from Facebook, but like, Well, I don''t know, here''s this Instagram thing, like that''s kind of cool.

I get great photo utility from that, which also lives on my home screen right there, and I''ll still use Facebook for seeing when my friends get married, but like photos cool.

And messaging, you know, this WhatsApp thing is super cool.

Like, if you just use that for messaging.

It''s super easy to use one app for one thing and other apps for others.

And you can see why Facebook adopted that sort of early 2010s constellation of apps strategy.

For a while, they had slingshot, poke, messenger, paper, rooms, riff, camera.

The belief by a lot of companies for the direction mobile was going was there''s going to be specialized apps each for their own tiny little purpose.

That''s not great if a lot of your value is we bundle a lot of stuff in to create the most user engagement to all feed into each other for people to use all these different components of our application.

Yep.

Totally.

Okay.

Those are my short list of five reasons of why the shift to mobile is dangerous to Facebook.

Anything else you would add?

No. So they''re going public right into this.

For the first time since our business is founded, we face a real existential threat completely out of our control that is going to make the next few years look really bad.

Let''s go public.

Yeah.

Well, let''s talk about that IPO.

Yes, but first, it is time to talk about one of our favorite companies, Statsig.

A phrase that many of you will know from Facebook''s early days is move fast and break things, but despite instilling this in Facebook''s engineering culture, Facebook didn''t actually break very often, and it essentially never goes down now.

How?

Well, Facebook invested hundreds of thousands of engineering hours in a set of internal tools.

These tools let any engineer set up new metrics, ship new features, and measure performance in real time.

This meant that anyone could just ship a new feature.

But they always had metrics to use as guardrails, and they could always roll back the feature if anything broke.

They took this so far that they have every new engineer ship a feature on their first day at the company.

Wild.

You might wish your team could build products like Facebook, right?

Ship fast, make data informed decisions, iterate rapidly, but you don''t work at Facebook and you don''t have those tools.

So you''re stuck, right?

Well, not anymore, thanks to Statsig.

Statsig was founded by an X-Mediteme three years ago with a mission to make these same tools that Facebook has available to any company.

Could there be a better sponsor for this episode, David?

This is insane.

I know.

It''s perfect.

That''s perfect.

Today, they''ve done it, combining tools like feature flags, product analytics, experimentation, and observability into one connected platform that runs off one set of data and infrastructure.

No more stringing together expensive point solutions and internal builds, and no more using technology vendors built five or 10 years ago when the needs of modern product teams have grown by leaps and bounds.

And they''ve also gotten some crazy traction over there at Statsig.

Many of the world''s leading tech companies rely on them, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Notion, Anthropic, Figma, plus thousands of early-stage startups.

In fact, their scale has gotten so crazy that they process over a trillion events per day.

For any engineers listening, they have a great blog post about how they do this.

And best of all, Statsig is pretty affordable.

They have an insanely generous free tier for small companies, a startup program with one billion free events, which is $50,000 in value, and significant discounts for enterprise customers.

To get started, just go to statsig.com slash acquired and remember to tell them that Ben and David sent you.

Thanks, statsig.

All right, so David, here we are.

We''re going public despite everything you just listed that is wrong with the future of mobile and this company.

Oh, man, which seems like a not very smart idea, right?

And, you know, like one thing about Mark Zuckerberg, you could say lots of things about him, but one thing I don''t think anybody could say is that he''s not smart.

So what gives, why are they doing this?

Well, back then, once a company crossed 500 shareholders, the SEC actually mandated by law that you had to start reporting quarterly like a public company.

Whether or not you were traded on an exchange.

Whether or not you were traded on an exchange.

And at the end of 2011, Facebook crossed 500 shareholders.

So, for Facebook, this means that they were going to have to report like a public company anyway.

And in practice, the common wisdom was you have to go public as part of this anyway, because otherwise you''re going to report and then you''re going to lose all the momentum and excitement about having an IPO and doing an S1 and having a big road show, et cetera, et cetera.

So you might as well just do the IPO as long as you''re going to have to do this.

And I think Mark and Cheryl and the team, like really debated, like, well, should we skip the IPO?

But like, well, shoot, then we''re going to be reporting as a public company and heading into all of these headwinds without having actually gone public and raised the money that we might need to be able to make these investments.

So they''re like, nope, we got to just do it and go public.

Yes, it is a odd time to go public, given everything with mobile.

And of course, they''re being forced into it.

There actually are a couple of kind of tailwinds that they have that are probably worth touching on here.

The first of which is they had just beat Google Plus, Facebook treated this like a total existential threat.

We laugh about Google Plus now.

It''s a butt of jokes, but that''s because Facebook was so effective in competing against it.

I''m not saying the product itself was amazing and it would have been fine without Facebook, but like Google did not end up executing that well on that product.

It actually is a really good point though.

Google plus may or may not have been a good product and may or may not have succeeded, but the Facebook competitive response was like.

Unbelievable.

Unbelievable.

I mean, this is like the growth team plus Facebook''s engineering culture at its finest in defeating this.

Whether or not they executed the product well, Google was the big web tech company at the time and they put a ton of resources and a lot of their best people on it.

And they had Gmail.

And they had Gmail, right.

Right.

So it''s interesting to look at this because Google basically is Facebook''s biggest business model comp.

They show ads on the web and they monetize that really well.

This theoretically could have been in their wheelhouse.

This is just more real estate to show ads on the web.

And they''ve already got all these people with user accounts.

You can see why Facebook took this really seriously.

We''ve talked a lot about Facebook''s technical prowess.

Well, here is an example of where it really kicks in when you need it to be a key competitive advantage.

So they structured themselves in a way that encouraged flexibility of engineers.

And they really broke from the tide of microservices in this era.

They had one monolithic code base that everyone worked out of.

And you might say, well, that''s stupid.

Why would they?

That''s not the way the world was going.

But what they basically did was they wanted to encourage portability of teams.

If you''re an engineer, you get hired into the company, not onto a team.

You learn the company''s codebase.

You learn the company''s conventions, and you can easily sort of move around after that.

You do have to deal with the trade-off then of you have this big model of the codebase with gigabytes of PHP code for thousands of engineers.

What do you do about that?

Well, then they just had their cake and eat it too.

They would go and have the infrastructure team figure out how to deal with that problem, rather than saying, oh, everyone can just work in their little silos.

And so that meant that engineers could kind of be quickly re-orged.

They could have this company wide lockdown to fight Google Plus.

And they did all sorts of things.

They launched video calls to compete with Hangouts.

They launched something to compete with Google Circles.

But either way, they could really quickly reallocate resources and people who sort of knew how to work together to defeat what could have really been an existential threat from their biggest similar company.

Oh, man, Mark famously in an internal speech around this, you know, referenced what was I think Kato the elder from ancient Rome of Carthage must be destroyed.

Yep.

There is a second way in which things had settled down and now was a good time to go public.

And that''s around privacy.

Facebook had just been, I mean, playing way too fast and loose with user privacy for years and it had finally caught up with them by 2011.

and just to jog your memories, I''m sure people may remember a lot of these.

Some of these included, even though users could restrict the audience of their posts with a setting, this apparently didn''t apply to apps, which could access these posts regardless of how you restricted the audience.

And for a time, this even included when your friends installed an app too, you didn''t even have to grant the permission yourselves.

Similarly, they made friend lists public without user consent at one point.

And Facebook could decide without user consent to change private fields of your profile to be public.

And this wasn''t always messaged as clearly as it could have been to users.

So to remedy this, they had just signed what is called a consent decree with the FTC, the US Federal Trade Commission in 2011.

And they promised to make a bunch of changes regarding user privacy issues going forward.

And so all this was behind them now.

Now, and interestingly, David, an FTC consent decree is the same thing that Microsoft signed.

Yeah, hark back to the Microsoft episode.

Yes, the FTC consent decree with Microsoft was the predecessor to the big DOJ suit.

In this case, the FTC consent decree is the predecessors to what eventually would become the Cambridge Analytica settlement.

So here in 2011, the way that they settled this is there''s a bunch of provisions that with Facebook promising they''ll be tighter on making sure user data is treated in a very particular way.

They''re subject to audit every year, for two years, for the next 20 years.

You know, there''s there''s all these things that they sort of agree to.

But, you know, once you sign a consent decree, it''s like, okay, we''re through it.

We don''t have this thing hanging over our heads.

We can go public and say, oh, yeah, that''s in the past.

We''ve taken care of it.

That''s another reason to go public right now.

Yeah, it''s such a good point.

There actually was this little window here at the beginning of 2012, where desktop revenue to hadn''t yet been impaired so badly that they could still show growth.

They had these couple little wins they could point to and say like, all right, not great, but like if we''re gonna do it, we gotta do it now.

Yeah, you could almost look at it like a little bit of a win of everyone knows us as the company that is a little bit dodgy on privacy practices.

Like at least the public perception is this, that they''re constantly changing the terms of the game.

from shall we say?

Yes.

To the company''s advantage when it was confusing or misleading to users.

Now you can say, look, not only do we sign that, we have these five product initiatives in place where we''re just buttoned up now.

I actually think that''s pretty true.

I think they became a company that had rigorous privacy practices because of some government regulation when they otherwise may not have.

If you look at the early days of what you could do as a developer on platform, it was pretty wild west.

And so I''m not saying it''s fully because of the consent decree, but they could definitely tell a story around, look, we made some mistakes.

We got some things wrong in privacy.

And going forward, we''re in good shape.

We''re all good.

Yeah.

Well, we''ll come back to that in a little bit.

But for the moment, the IPO February 1st, 2012, they filed the S1.

They entered the traditional quiet period before the IPO where legally, according to the SEC, once you have filed for an IPO, all material information about the company needs to be included in the S1 registration statement.

You can''t go give interviews, you can''t go talk to the press, you can''t say anything meaningful about the company besides what is fully publicly disclosed to any potential investor in the S1 statement.

And then a week later on April 9th, 2012, during the quiet period, Facebook acquires Instagram for a billion dollars times now, baby.

Time is now.

And they can''t say anything about it besides what they file in the amended S1 because they''re in the quiet period.

Amazing.

The company''s previous largest acquisition was $70 million.

Obviously this is a way different thing.

Now, sitting here today, you might be really tempted to say, oh, well, there''s the fix for mobile.

They just bought Instagram.

That solved all the problems, except not because Instagram didn''t have any revenue on mobile either.

It''s like, you know, you''re tying one anchor to another here.

Well, not to mention, Instagram had 27 million users.

Facebook had 900 million users.

This was potentially a problem for a future Facebook, but this was not currently a problem.

Totally, I was just about to say that too.

Like, yeah, also not currently a fix to Facebook''s major problem of the shift to mobile.

And I mean, my God, talk about the Hutzba of Mark to do this.

You''re already in a really challenging period for the company, a really challenging IPO process.

you just entered the quiet period and you decide to spend a billion dollars on something with 27 million users in no revenue and you''re not going to be able to talk about it except what you file with the SEC.

Wow, you got a really, really, really freaking believe in the future potential of your company and the combined companies of Facebook and Instagram here to make this move.

Not to mention, on top of it all, we''re not going to go into it here because we had a whole episode on Facebook and Instagram.

But this was done over two days over the course of a weekend.

Mark didn''t do a whole lot of socializing this before pulling the trigger.

He just knew it was the right thing to do and did it.

Yep.

And then it ended up working out pretty well in the long run.

In the short run, yet another question, Mark, to add to the already very large pile around this company.

Finally, long road show process by the week of May 14th, they''re ready to price the IPO.

pricing is set for Thursday night, May 17th, 2012.

On Tuesday, May 15th, General Motors, GM, who by the way was not a particularly large Facebook advertiser, announces publicly to the world that they are pulling all their spend off of the Facebook platform because it''s not effective.

Not really what you want to have happen to nights before you price your IPO.

was that motivated by someone that feels like a hit feels like it must have been I''ve never heard one where the other but like a why would you announce that publicly b why would you announce it publicly right then like there''s for sure more to that story nonetheless Facebook goes ahead Thursday night they priced the IPO at $38 a share at the very top end of the range after the road show again the That''s by here.

They raise $16 billion at a $104 billion market cap, making it, I think, the third largest IPO of all time at that point, behind Visa and ironically, General Motors coming out of the bankruptcy during 2008.

Which both of those are mature companies that are going public under weird circumstances.

Those are not comps.

Totally, yes.

By far, the largest IPO of a new startup company in history, On Friday morning, trading starts.

The NASDAQ is overloaded with so many orders for buying and selling Facebook.

That trading in Facebook stock doesn''t actually open until 11.30 AM, which is two plus hours after the open on the markets.

Gotta be terrifying if you''re a big Facebook shareholder.

Yeah, that''s pretty terrifying.

Initially, it looks like that delay might have been good because the price shoots up to $45 a share from 38.

But then it crashes back down.

It is one of the most volatile trading days in any stock.

I think history on any exchange.

Facebook shares end the day at $38.23 up 23 cents from the IPO price, but only because all of the underwriting banks in the IPO stepped in to buy shares and support the price, which was totally crashing throughout the day.

Thank God they did it on a Friday, so everybody had the weekend to breathe.

Once trading starts again the following week, the price falls on nine of the next 13 trading days and ends up by the end of May down 25% from the initial IPO price of $38, kind of are ultimately bottoms out on September 4th, 2012, at $17.68 down 53.5% from the IPO price.

So market cap cut in, you know, over half in what''s that?

Five months since the IPO.

It wouldn''t end up reaching IPO price again until August 2013.

Anyone who bought at the IPO was underwater for 16 months.

Underwater for 16 months and five months later had lost half their money on Facebook.

So you have to have nerds of steel to even just keep holding.

I''m sure anybody who got back to even at 16 months was delighted.

Totally.

You''ve also got the employee lock up coming up around November.

So like now you''re staring down the gun of, shoot, I''ve already lost half of my value as a public company and pretty soon all the employees in the company are going to be able to selling, that''s going to put more selling pressure on the stock.

Holy crap.

This is pretty darn bad.

Yes, that is horrible.

I mean, losing 50% of your value as any company public or private, but especially public company is a disaster of epic proportions.

Having that happen immediately following your IPO, for most companies, there''s no way to come back from that.

you''re entering a death spiral, you''re going to end up being acquired, or you''re just going to get driven to zero, basically.

Yep.

And just to be super clear, desktop revenue wasn''t going to go to zero immediately.

But Wall Street investors are really worried that, hey, the world is transitioning to mobile.

Eventually, growth will start slowing, and it will start declining, which it does fairly quickly here.

And so like, if you can''t show me that you''re going to replace that with mobile revenue, why should I value your stock at anything?

Yep.

And so here is where founder control matters.

This is, David, it''s interesting you''re explaining the mechanics of a death spiral.

That would presume there''s a board of directors who feels a strong desire to do whatever is best in the interest of the shareholder.

And they might think that it''s these short term things.

But if you have a CEO who has a 20 year view and believes deep, deep in his heart that the best is yet to come and that this is just a temporary problem and that person controls the company and owns the majority of voting shares, you can withstand things like this.

You just better be right.

So, a little fun anecdote for everyone.

David and I, among the 20 other people we talked to to prefer this episode, one of them was Cheryl Sandberg.

And we were asking Cheryl, in particular, how did you start the monetization effort on mobile?

They were in the third column, there''s no third column on mobile.

What did you do?

And her comment to us was, oh, we just stopped caring about the right side ads on desktop.

And we took every engineering resource we could off of that and we put it on mobile and we knew we were going to miss the current quarter.

I think they missed a lot of quarters right after their IPO.

But this was us trading the present for the future and all we cared about was our future.

And she said, this is great quote.

This is up there with one of the best quotes on acquired of all time.

She was sitting there with Mark late at night and when they sort of arrived at this plan of we you''re going to forego a lot of desktop revenue to basically bet it all on figuring out mobile revenue.

She said, well, Mark, nobody can fire you and only you can fire me.

So if you''re in, I''m in.

And we buckled our seat belt and we said, here we go.

And it''s amazing.

I mean, that can only happen in a founder controlled company.

And it really did force them to figure out mobile advertising.

If they really are saying like, this is the new first class product, this is where we''re going to point all advertisers toward.

If they''re wrong on that, they''re wrong across the whole board.

Because if ads suck on mobile, since it''s the only thing and it''s filling up your whole screen, user engagement is also going to nose dive.

And so it''s basically a bed at all moment, where the ads are front and center.

So they must be good.

It is essential for the mobile product and thus your company for them to be good.

Users attention will be pointed at these ads.

Like no other ads, you have ever run before.

And actually, the flip side of this is ended up being the best thing ever for the company.

Because the ads are front and center, the value per ad is actually higher.

' figure out mobile advertising.

If they really are saying like, this is the new first class product, this is where we''re going to point all advertisers toward.

If they''re wrong on that, they''re wrong across the whole board.

Because if ads suck on mobile, since it''s the only thing and it''s filling up your whole screen, user engagement is also going to nose dive.

And so it''s basically a bed at all moment, where the ads are front and center.

So they must be good.

It is essential for the mobile product and thus your company for them to be good.

Users attention will be pointed at these ads.

Like no other ads, you have ever run before.

And actually, the flip side of this is ended up being the best thing ever for the company.

Because the ads are front and center, the value per ad is actually higher.

So they ended up creating a much, much more valuable ad unit than they ever had on desktop, purely because of this incredible attention on them when you''re scrolling in feed on mobile.

Necessity is the absolute mother of invention.

Yes, totally.

You have no choice, but to do your best work, and boy, didn''t work out fabulously.

Yeah.

Ben, nobody can fire you.

Well, I guess you can''t fire me either.

But either way, if you''re in the corporate structure required is still a little, it''s unclear.

But yes, totally.

So when we say taking your best, most trusted engineers, taking them off, whatever they''re doing, and putting them on ads, there''s actually an amazing story around this.

So Mark goes to someone within the company who he knows can just ship and get stuff done.

And that is Bos and your Bosworth, his old TA from Harvard.

Bos at this point is running the core profile and timeline within Facebook.

And Mark goes and talk to him and says, Boz, I think you should come work on ads to which Boz replies, okay, I mean, like I get we''re in this situation, but you know, Mark, like I can''t do this for too long because remember I''m getting married this fall and I''ve got this six month sabbatical plan for my honeymoon and my wife and I we''re gonna get travel the world.

It''s all like booked and paid for.

We''re gonna be out of the country.

And Mark is like, yes.

Yes.

Well, we''ve got a few months until then.

I think you should come over and work on ads.

I was like, okay, okay, I will do that.

I will come up with something here before the wedding.

So he teams up with Will Cathcart from the newsfeed team, from Chris Cox''s team, and they go get to work.

By the way, Will is the head of WhatsApp today.

And Boss, of course, is the CTO of Meta and head of Reality Labs.

And the first thing they do during these couple months is like, all right, we just need like a band-aid to stop the bleeding and at least produce some mobile revenue.

And what they decide to do is like, hey, we do have on mobile the carousel of people you may like.

What if we just slot some brands into that carousel and say, hey, in addition to people you may like here, here are some brand pages you may like, a reasonable first step.

And look, they knew that this wasn''t going to be the long-term solution and solve all mobile revenue that they could report.

And this was super important because as I alluded to, the lockup on employees and insiders selling their shares expired in November, they had to get something out that was going to prop the stock price up a little bit before naturally employees are going to start selling here and that''s going to put downward pressure on the stock price.

Yep.

Also, bummer, if you are an employee selling six months after that IPO, hopefully as many people held as they could get through it.

Yes, hopefully.

And I think most people who were at Facebook at this time really did believe in the future of the company.

At the same time, you have life circumstances.

You might need to buy a house.

You might need to do things for your family, et cetera.

It''s a tough spot.

So fall rolls around, they''ve launched sponsored pages you may like, Bos gets married, they''re is getting real honest to God native ads in the news feed, which frankly, they should have done years ago on desktop.

But like now, now the gun is to their head.

There is nothing in the mobile app except news feed.

We got to put ads in news feed.

So finally, at the end of the year, they launch it, boss is like, woo, okay.

Mission accomplished.

I can now leave on my sabbatical.

We can go on our honeymoon, but there''s just one problem.

Shipping this thing is only like 20% of the battle.

Now you have to go sell it to advertisers, which this is a whole new ad paradigm.

You got to like educate brands on why this is going to work for them, especially when your overall brand as a company and effectiveness of your advertising is kind of in the dumps right now.

And it''s an iterative process where you''re going to hear a bunch of feedback from brands and you''re going to say, oh, we had to modify the ad products, which still continues to this day that you roll out and modify ad products is not like a, all right, we now have ads in the news feed, we''re good.

The job is never done here.

So of course, quarterbacking all this is gonna fall to Cheryl and her team.

But again, as you said, Ben, this is an iterative process.

You can''t divorce product from the feedback from advertisers.

And the big advertisers are sure as hell gonna expect someone from product who is leading this thing to show up and tell them about it.

Yep.

So Boss kind of needs to come along to these meetings.

So on December 18th, Boss remembers the exact day, Mark calls him up and is like, Boss, great job working on ads.

Hey, I really still need you to come back and work on ads.

Boss is like, no way, man.

I did the past six months for you.

I just got married.

I''m going on my honeymoon, I''m out.

Mark''s like, okay, okay, okay.

The next day, calls him back December 19th and he''s like, buzz.

I just want to say really, really great job again.

And you know, the company''s in a really tough spot.

And like, I really think that you should come keep running ads here.

And buzz like, okay, all right.

I will reduce my sabbatical from six months to six weeks.

I''ll take the holidays, the beginning of the year.

I''m going to cancel the last four months of my trip.

I will do six weeks with my wife and then we''ll fly her friends out to the last two weeks with her and then I''m going to go fly around the world with Cheryl on a very different kind of trip here.

So that''s what they do and for most of 2013, Bosn Cheryl are out on the road.

They''re pitching advertisers, they''re explaining sponsored stories in the newsfeed on mobile, why this is so important.

And not only do advertisers need education about this new Facebook ad unit, they also need education about mobile advertising in general.

They''d only just gotten used to digital advertising on desktop.

Totally.

Do you remember those Mary Meeker decks that used to go around where they would show the mobile advertising, basically the shortcoming?

Look at all this attention that has shifted to mobile and yet the monetization just isn''t there.

And that was a story every year for like a decade.

Yep.

total.

And it was the same story with desktop on the web for a decade before that.

So what''s interesting is, as they''re getting going here, of course, advertisers don''t come in right away.

But also the ones that do come in early are, as you would imagine, not the best advertisers.

And so the whole effort starts to have this real problem where the ads that are now showing up in newsfeed are like pretty freaking crappy ads and Mark keeps getting more and more pissed because like obviously this is really important but he''s like boss Cheryl like why the hell is all this crap showing up in my feed like if this keeps happening I get that we have to save the business but like I care more about the user experience and like I''m gonna dial this back.

This is the most interesting thing at this point in history Mark is putting pressure on Bosn Cheryl to show fewer ads.

Yes.

And Bosn is the one with the contrarian view who comes to Mark and says, we''re thinking about this all wrong.

We actually need way more ads.

Not just a little more ads, huge amounts more ads because a great ad is on par with content.

And if you have tons and tons of ads, then we can do way better targeting.

Like you have this beautiful liquid marketplace of hundreds of thousands of advertisers, billions of users, and at any given time, somebody can see the optimal ad for them and get recommended an amazing product that perfectly fits their needs in that moment with messaging that''s perfectly tailored for them.

Great advertising can be great, but you need a really, really liquid marketplace and you need fantastic algorithms, which you can only have if you train them on tons and tons of data.

So like we actually need 10,000 times more ads than we have right now, not less.

It''s almost like the only way out is through.

We''re going down this path.

We must be extremely successful in order to be successful at all.

This was such a contrarian view and also right.

And I think only could have come from someone like Boz being focused on this problem because as a product person in an engineer it''s the only way that you''re going to have that insight that like, oh, this is the same problem we had when we launched newsfeed.

The way to fix newsfeed and to make it really, really awesome is more newsfeed.

And you know, his more data, right?

You''re the only way out is through.

Yeah.

If somebody had purely come, I think, from the advertising world, they would have been like, well, you know, that''s just the nature of advertising, right?

It''s attacks on the users, and that''s the way monetization of media works.

But like, Boss was like, no, no, actually, this is a relevance problem, and we can make this awesome.

And in order to make it awesome, we need a lot more of it.

Yep.

And basically, like, that''s what happened.

I mean, flash forward 10 years, I open Instagram to get great product recommendations.

Totally.

It''s actually kind of wild.

I believe this is true.

There are markets in the world today where I think meta has run this test, where if you turn off ads in the meta family of apps products, engagement in those products actually goes down, which is just like freaking wild.

You would think like, oh, wow, now I get to use meta products without advertising.

No tax on me like I''m gonna engage more like no it goes down.

That''s the definition of ads as content if that''s actually the case.

Totally wild.

So by the fourth quarter of 2013 which honestly in the scheme of things is pretty freaking fast.

The whole thing finally flips.

Facebook announces that mobile advertising is now 53% of revenue and total ad revenue for the company grew 76% year over year in the fourth quarter, which of course is the most important quarter of the year, which means I did all the math on that.

That means that all of desktop revenue, all of it.

So the old platform business, the old ad business, the Microsoft third parties ad serving, all of that actually shrank in the fourth quarter of 2013.

13.

So that''s the counterfactual here.

If Facebook had not gotten mobile monetization right, that''s what would have happened is Q4 2013, all of the growth momentum that it had would have flipped and it would have started the downward spiral.

And probably not that early if...

I guess that''s right, because all the resources got pulled off of it.

Exactly, but that''s what would have happened eventually to it.

Eventually, yep, yep.

Some man is like this wild 18 month journey, but it totally saved the company because now here they are, they''ve built this unique pioneering and totally defensible native mobile ad unit in the feed.

They define the whole generation of monetization here.

It''s the best ad unit in history.

It''s an ad that completely fills the screen on your device, and that users are okay with.

So this is the most insanely captivating, engaging ad unit that you could possibly ask for, and it came out of necessity.

It''s wild, the fact that they thought their backs were against the wall, they were totally screwed, and instead actually it''s the thing that monetizes better and is better for advertisers than any other advertising product they''ve ever had.

And I know we keep saying this, and it sounds maybe sort of silly, but like really better for users too, So, before this paradigm that they invent here of, you know, algorithmically driven ads in the feed, the biggest monetizing thing on mobile was an interstitial like pop up fricking display ad that took over your screen, right, like what an awful fricking experience for a user.

Right.

Right around this time too, the other thing that''s happening is kind of glossed over this for time.

But Facebook''s initial attempt at a mobile app was to try to work around all the constraints of the mobile app ecosystem.

And they thought, well, that''s nice that the app stores are going to try and box us in.

But we''ll just ship our mobile web views inside of a thin little app wrapper.

And that way we can deploy multiple times a day.

You know, we''re Facebook.

This is what we do.

It''s part of our culture.

It''s DML five.

Woo.

Provided a horrible user experience.

I mean, the engagement on the app was low, time spent was low.

It was a risk to start selling these ads because people don''t want to spend any time in the app, even without ads, let alone when you start layering these in.

And so they''re finally starting to sort of pull out of this tail spin.

They basically spent a year completely rewriting all their mobile clients to be these rich, beautiful, native experiences.

This is a thing that Facebook has always been good at.

Whenever they decide to do something, they go and recruit like the actual best talent in the world to do it, the group of people that they pulled together from Joe Hewitt forward to write their original iOS app, it''s just like some of the best iOS developers and designers in the world.

They hired Mike Mattis and the push pop press team when they acquired them.

That''s right, that''s right.

That became, I think it was creative labs, is that right?

Facebook creative labs, but a huge amount of that talent worked on their mobile apps, and so while they had the wrong strategy at first, once they got religion around native, they really created something probably one of the best apps ever on mobile.

Totally.

It''s funny.

I''m laughing.

You know, the version of history that we just told is maybe slightly too charitable to Facebook and to Mark because yes, it''s absolutely true.

They did the really hard thing.

They took the pain.

They invested in the future.

They built, you know, everything that would become Facebook and meta today out of it.

But the first reaction was to bet on hope as a strategy and bring your head in the sand and say, HTML5 is going to save us.

I don''t know that it was hope as a strategy.

I think it was more like if this can work, it''s going to solve a lot of our problems.

And I don''t think they correctly estimated how wide the user experience chasm is between web apps and native apps.

And I think they had to like have an app in market where users were actually using it to realize, oh, man, the state of the art in native that the platform vendors have developed iOS and Android is really, really good.

And they have brought very little of that to the web experiences, partially because of standards bodies, but also partially because it''s not really in their interests to make web apps great when they can force everything through a an app store that they have more control over.

So, okay, after the Q4 2013 earnings announcement, the stock pops way, way, way up to like 175 billion-ish market cap.

So up 75% from IPO, you know, what is that year and a half earlier.

And from there, it''s basically, if you look at the market cap chart, kind of a straight line journey from 175 five up to half a trillion over the next couple of years.

They eventually bring this whole native feed monetization engine over to Instagram and that works, obviously, incredibly well there, probably better than even on the blue app.

And that in particular, I mean, everyone''s going to laugh when we say this word, the legitimate synergy between going to an advertiser and saying, you can use this dashboard to get placements on Facebook and on Instagram is massive.

Both of those products monetize better than they ever could without that single channel that the advertiser only has to go through and use one dashboard to place on both products.

If you flash all the way forward to today, the lion''s share of Meta''s revenue comes from the ads that run on Facebook and Instagram.

Their whole business today can just be summarized as that.

Totally.

There''s another element for a couple of years that''s a big part of the native mobile revenue story and that is App install ads.

It actually is worth calling out because it plants the seeds of this much larger struggle that''s going to come in a little bit.

But a very large percentage of the inventory that they were selling and especially the revenue of these native mobile ads in the beginning was actually for App install ads that game developers and other folks were buying on Facebook.

So it was kind of like our old platform business all over again.

Facebook is actually the best place to discover apps on mobile.

Yeah, it''s pretty interesting realization where the big brand advertisers may not move to this new type of ad format right away, but the people that are going to be really hungry to move to that ad format are a game developer who makes a mobile app and wants to market their mobile app to to people who are A on that platform and B in a lean back experience where they''re open for some entertainment.

And when you are scrolling through a feed of your friends and brands and you are open to, oh, hey, look at this.

A game where I could click one button and then boom and install a game and play it.

Is there a better moment and channel to reach someone for an app?

No, I mean, even if you''re Apple, Apple doesn''t have a better way to do this.

people don''t search the app store for apps that often.

So you''d have to show them like a pop-up ad or something.

Facebook just has this opportunity where you''re in an experience where you''re open to some new form of entertainment and they have the ability to place a button there with rigorous targeting and incredible ad sales force.

Facebook was almost built to be the monetizable front end to the app store.

Oh, boy.

All right.

Put a pin in there.

Am I leading the witness too much, David?

Put a pin in that we are going to talk about Apple and Facebook in just a little bit here.

Now I said a minute ago that the journey to 500 billion in market cap from here is a straight line.

If you look at the market cap chart that''s true, internally within the company, I think almost certainly not there, a couple of big challenges that come up along the way.

During this period, you''ve got SNAP and you''ve got WhatsApp, both of which are like pretty big deals.

We''ve covered both of those pretty fully on separate episodes that you can go listen to.

But I think ultimately what they represent, obviously SNAP was more a competitor and WhatsApp turned into an acquisition and is now a big part of Meta and part of the company.

But I think together what they represent was this next fundamental shift in the consumer social landscape, which Mark totally picked up on and ultimately announced as the core of the company''s product strategy in 2019, which was the default social behavior was moving from town square, which was the old Facebook paradigm of like, hey, we''re all or public, here''s what I think.

Yup, and in many ways, Instagram was also town square.

Totally.

The Instagram team noticed over time that even before Snap started eating their lunch, that engagement would decrease.

The longer you stayed an Instagram user, because you over time being done with these permanent posts and you sort of saved it for the big announcements in your life, that there wasn''t a natural way to just effortlessly share, because when these platforms all started, everyone was in debt sharing with the town square the whole time.

And everyone was getting a little bit more clammy about that as time went on.

Yeah.

As the stage got bigger in the town square, it''s like, well, I''m not going to take the stage unless I like really have a great performance that I''m going to give.

And so every piece of data and metric that they had, you''re right, they sort of realized, oh, the world is shifting from town square to to living room is the way that Mark put it, that social was shifting from town square to living room.

Right.

And by living room, he means small private groups of super close relationships.

Yep.

And Snap and WhatsApp were both really interesting data points about this.

What''s app obviously with private messaging?

Snap also in its own way.

There was the original Snapchat use case of disappearing one-to-one photo messaging.

But stories really is where it became clear, Hey, this is widespread and this is a big problem that is going to threaten Instagram, Facebook, the whole default motion of like sharing beyond just a one-to-one messaging platform.

I want that to be much more private and locked down too.

If you own an engagement platform and someone figures out a new mechanic to make them much more willing to freeform share and your platform seems to encourage them to stay back, be quiet, and only post once in a while, maybe lurk, it''s not good.

Content creation on the platform going down is really, really bad if you are an engagement company.

Snap represents the idea that people are sharing way more if it''s a femoral and WhatsApp represented the idea that people are shifting the places they communicate from more public to more private and from larger groups to smaller groups, both of which are concerning if you are Facebook blue app.

Okay, so now, here''s an interesting question though.

How would Facebook know that attention is really shifting to these apps?

Because remember, we''re now in the mobile paradigm, not on the open web, where it surfaces like CommScore and Alexa and whatnot exist and you can see traffic and engagement competitively on other apps.

In the mobile ecosystem, it''s all siloed and locked down.

No, just Apple and Google really have that information.

Yeah, but somehow Facebook was able to get pretty good insights on what was happening in the landscape.

Well, to have that, you would either need to have some kind of SDK that gets bundled into apps like an analytics provider, or you would need like a VPN where like the traffic was going through it so you could see the traffic.

Well, in 2013, Facebook acquired a small Israeli company called Onovo.

Onovo was exactly what you just said, Ben, a VPN.

Actually, I think it initially started as like a data compression tool.

Also, if you were worried about your data plan, which was really important in many parts of the world, you could install Onovo on your device and it would compress the data and then serve it to your apps.

Eventually, that morphed into a VPN tool.

The net of that is that they could actually see traffic and usage data going into specific apps on mobile phones in their network.

Yeah, I think they looked at it as we need some way to level the playing field if we''re competing against Apple and Google in different ways and they have this data because they own the platforms, we kind of need to be able to see those same trends.

On the other hand, there is another way to view this.

If you''re looking for examples where Facebook may have considered their own interests over being forthright with users, over how their data is used, well, this could be another big example.

Users who were using Onavo didn''t download it with the intent of sharing their app usage data with Facebook.

Right.

They were just looking to compress their data or for a VPN service.

Either way, Onavo ended up being a hugely important acquisition for Facebook because it really tipped them off to WhatsApp and Snap 2.

Yeah.

Obviously, they fought those two companies in very different ways.

One thing they learned from fighting Twitter over the years is that there are these social mechanics or perhaps an interaction paradigm might be the right way to talk about it.

A post or a like or a retweet or a disappearing photo message.

And the thing that kind of matters is owning a valuable network.

The idea that people are going to come and give you their attention and you own the place that they connect with other people that they authentically verifiably know.

That''s the scarce commodity in order to kind of win the engagement game.

And the mechanics are actually kind of fungible.

And they''re totally a means to an end.

So if you discover some mechanic and you build this whole multi-hundred million user network platform, ad platform based on it, that''s great.

As long as no one comes up with a better mechanic than you and then goes and rebuilds the network somewhere else.

So one thing they learned with Twitter was, hmm, they seem to be growing really fast with this status update thing.

We need to look a lot more like status updates.

And that worked pretty well.

There were a lot of people that basically never switched to Twitter because they thought, oh, I can just use Facebook for this.

Yeah, and I already have my network in here.

I already have my friends, I already have my connections, totally.

And it also has photos.

So like Twitter is this weird esoteric text sharing thing.

I''m not really all about that.

I''m just going to keep using Facebook.

Oh, then Twitter did have photos for a while.

It was called Instagram.

Well, yeah, that API got turned off fast.

Yep.

So as they''re looking around at Snap, hey, someone has discovered this new stories mechanic.

My goodness, that is suddenly obvious that that is what the future is.

It now feels old to do anything else.

It''s kind of like when you got a retina iPhone for the first time and you''re like holding your non-retina iPhone and you''re like, this is instantly a piece of crap.

Like, I''m not ever gonna touch this discussing thing again.

I think when someone invents a new interaction paradigm, it''s one of these things where like, you have to adopt it.

Because otherwise, people are just going to flee.

And of course, your business depends on you adopting it, because you can''t let someone use this new discovered mechanic that''s perfectly timed for this moment in history with these set of cultural acceptances and this new set of technologies to go rebuild the network somewhere else.

And so I think the thing that they sort of discover is either through buying or through copying a mechanic, we need to protect our network by bringing these interactions into our family of apps, either by, as Ben Thompson would put it, the audacity of copying well or, of course, by buying them.

Yes, copying well or buying well.

Yes.

So listeners, of course, we don''t actually ever know what anybody''s intent is or what they''re thinking when they decide to buy a company or something like that.

This is just sort of David and I guessing at strategy from the outside.

We do have thanks to a court case, an actual email from Mark Zuckerberg on February 28th.

Oh, yeah.

This is so good.

2012 to their then CFO talking about the time they''re sort of discussing the Instagram acquisition, but laying out the idea behind an acquisition strategy.

The basic plan would be to buy these companies and leave their products running while over time incorporating the social dynamics they''ve invented into our core products.

One thing that may make neutralizing a potential competitor, More reasonable here is that there are network effects around social products and a finite number of different social mechanics to invent.

Once someone wins at a specific mechanic, it''s difficult for others to supplant them without doing something different.

It''s possible someone beats Instagram by building something that is better to the point where they get network migration, but this is harder as long as Instagram keeps running as a product.

Pause.

Which is pretty interesting.

That is the argument of why to keep Instagram separate and running as its own product is because Instagram''s already discovered this fascinating new mechanic around publishing one image at a time with these beautiful filters.

If anybody else tries to come after them, they''re already ahead.

So actually the best thing to do is own Instagram and let it keep doing its thing.

Anyway, resuming.

Integrating their products with ours to improve the service is also a factor, but in reality, we already know these companies social mechanics and we will integrate them over the next 12 to 24 months anyway.

The integration plan involves building their mechanics into our products rather than directly integrating their products, if that makes sense.

By a combination of these two things, neutralizing a potential competitor, integrating their products with ours to improve the service, one way of looking at this is that what we''re really buying is time.

Even if some new competitor springs up, buying Instagram, path, four square, etc.

Now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.

Within that time, if we incorporate the social mechanics they are using, those new products won''t get much traction because we will already have their mechanics deployed at scale.

It is God damn brilliant, David.

here''s my commentary based on all this.

It is so smart to basically say, well, if we buy them, we basically get two strategies that we get to execute at the same time.

One, we just leave them alone and let it keep succeeding.

It''s actually not a current potential thread.

We don''t know if it will turn into a potential thread.

Hell, Instagram wasn''t making any money yet.

that what''s app didn''t have a feed?

It was just a way people connected.

It''s not like just because they had a network, they were gonna turn it into a feed.

So there''s this idea that it''s not a competitor now by buying it, we basically get this option on if it becomes a competitor, if we completely leave them alone and let them decide what to do.

But then there''s also, look, we will integrate those mechanics into our core product, Facebook, the blue app, that already has well-built out network effects.

And by owning this thing that could become a competitor, there isn''t white space in the middle.

Anyone just like us is also going to take time, and they''re not going to do it as good as the original, and they don''t have our network, therefore whether the winner turns out to be the original product or us incorporating the mechanic into the blue app, we''ve won either way.

And probably what''s going to happen is both.

Yes.

So brilliant.

And that is what happened with Instagram.

What''s app is actually kind of different.

It never really turned into a competitor.

computer, it just serves a completely different use case and is also owned by Meta.

And then with Snap, they tried to buy Snap over and over again, and it didn''t work.

And so they basically figured out how to bring those mechanics into Facebook''s core products with stories in a way that Snap kept doing their thing, but there was really no reason to leave being an Instagram user because you already had that functionality with your own network anyway.

And here''s what''s really interesting about the stories, quote-unquote, story in Instagram and then ultimately coming to the blue app.

Stories as initially launched by Snap in the Snapchat app was a separate tab with a list of your friends who had published stories, who''s literally like a table, like a list.

Oh, I don''t remember that, really?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, it wasn''t, you know, the paradigm we all think of today as like the heads in the row at the top of your app, Instagram did that.

So when Instagram copied, quote, unquote stories and launched stories, they launched it as the algorithmically ordered row of heads at the top of your app.

And here''s where the internal advantages that Facebook, the family of apps had, they already had this world class ranking algorithmic expertise within in the company that was being applied to newsfeed, that was being applied to ads that was already starting to incorporate early ML and early AI, the beginning of Fair Facebook AI research lab had already happened here.

This was coming into the product.

Well, now when you''re launching a new feature like this in this case stories, you can say, oh, great, is this gonna be made better by our algorithmic and AI expertise?

Of course it is, let''s do that.

Right, that''s interesting.

Basically, even if you copy the feature wholesale, it''s actually even better, not just because you have the network, but because your algorithm tech is very advanced.

You can make sure it''s the most possible engaging version of that particular interaction design.

Yes.

So when Instagram, in those early days, when it was launching stories, they were optimizing the ranking of heads at the top of the app by how likely you are to tap on that person''s head.

Of course.

Of course they''re doing that.

I do want to jump forward to TikTok.

Yes, let''s do it because it''s a continuation of this story in a very different way.

In the mid-20 teens here, there''s a bunch of other stuff that we''ve got to get to, but TikTok is particularly interesting because it kind of blindsided Facebook.

Yes.

If you believe that the asset that matters is the authenticated real name network of people you actually know or people you care about following, you kind of think, oh, I always have a lead, as long as I can incorporate someone''s mechanic.

What if engagement is possible on an app that has nothing to do with your social network?

That''s terrifying because this big asset that you''ve built, this durable competitive advantage of we already have all the people, so why would you wanna go anywhere where your friends aren''t?

The magic of TikTok was AI suddenly in the late 20 teens became sufficiently advanced that it could show you the optimal thing created by anyone in the world, most of the time, you don''t actually know that person.

So suddenly, the only competitive advantage that Facebook the company has is people have a habit of tapping on their apps when they''re bored, but that''s a pretty thin competitive advantage.

That''s really easy to break.

Habits are changeable, especially on a mobile phone where another app is just an icon away.

Totally.

And so if someone is a great competitor like TikTok, who is incredibly well-funded, very good at strategically buying ads, has created their own growth function that is, there are just a very different animal and there are very well-executing machine.

And, you know, they obey a completely different set of laws, rules, regulation, norms, being a Chinese company, that created a competitor for Facebook that is more significant than anything they''ve ever faced.

This wasn''t like, oh, there might be an existential threat from this in the future.

This was like, oh, crap.

As soon as people form a habit around, oh, I just opened this black app with the white little music note on it, we have no more competitive advantages to throw at that problem.

So we must, as fast as possible, make something like reels just to stem the bleeding.

And then we can figure out what to do from there and hopefully get to a market stalemate with them.

Yeah, which is basically what has happened, but interestingly tick-tock and bite-dance its parent company, as you point out then, was so completely orthogonal to everything that Facebook had learned over the past 15 years, because yes, number one, most importantly, it''s not social media, it''s media, there''s no social, and your graph doesn''t matter anymore.

That''s a great point.

Right.

It''s digital media, it''s user created media, it''s mobile media, but it''s really not social media.

Yep.

Doesn''t matter who your friends are on TikTok.

What matters is in the first 10 videos you look at, is there AI pretty good at picking up the stuff that you care about and the stuff that you don''t?

It''s not, can you find a whole bunch of other people you know?

Yep.

And I really want to keep hitting on this insight again that Mark correctly identified of social shifting from the town square to the living room.

This is a second order effect of that shift that the company didn''t see coming because once you shift social from the town square to the living room, it now becomes possible to divorce media from social.

You''re already getting your social now in private in your digital living room.

The town square can become something that is completely not social.

Right, it''s turned into this pretty interesting dual pronged approach that they now have, which is you open Instagram and you have reels.

So the job to be done by TikTok is now done by a thing that you already have habit around.

It''s bundled into the place where you actually consume your social media.

Great.

That''s step one.

Step two is this is where it''s nice to have WhatsApp.

This is where it''s nice to have messenger.

For these living room style conversations where just a few of your friends, the new user behavior is I see a thing that got millions of views.

I can think of one or five people to share that with and then I have a private conversation about this public object in private.

I will share that on WhatsApp or I will share that on I message or I will share that on you know whatever my my actual friend living room network of choices and from where social networking started back in 2004 and ending up now in this reasonably complex interaction paradigm of I get AI-served videos from people I don''t know tailored to me and then I privately share those in multiple groups with those who I love and care about.

That''s a huge evolution.

It''s crazy that we use the term social network or social media for these two things that are like light years apart.

Totally.

'''s nice to have WhatsApp.

This is where it''s nice to have messenger.

For these living room style conversations where just a few of your friends, the new user behavior is I see a thing that got millions of views.

I can think of one or five people to share that with and then I have a private conversation about this public object in private.

I will share that on WhatsApp or I will share that on I message or I will share that on you know whatever my my actual friend living room network of choices and from where social networking started back in 2004 and ending up now in this reasonably complex interaction paradigm of I get AI-served videos from people I don''t know tailored to me and then I privately share those in multiple groups with those who I love and care about.

That''s a huge evolution.

It''s crazy that we use the term social network or social media for these two things that are like light years apart.

Totally.

The social and the media is now completely divorced and that is because of the shift from town square to living room.

Yeah.

We really need to evolve our or language around all this stuff.

Okay, so that, I think, is dimension one that TikTok is completely orthogonal to Facebook.

Dimension two is actually organizationally.

So TikTok, as we chronicled on our episode about it a couple of years ago, came out of Bydance.

Well, it was an acquisition of musically by Bydance and then Bydance turned it into TikTok.

Bydance had totiao before having TikTok.

Bydance is an AI company.

Bydance is not a product company, and the core product that Bydance makes is its AI.

Along with all sorts of other stuff, TikTok is like the product vector, one of many in the biggest, by which they deploy their actual product, which is AI.

This is very, very different from Facebook, which has always been a product company.

And so, like, organizationally, the way bite dance is set up is there these centers of excellence within the company, where the algorithms, the AI, that is controlled by a centralized team within the company, at least that''s my perception of how they''re different organizationally from how Facebook used to be.

Facebook and Facebook leadership was obviously watching this very, very closely.

And if you look at how meta is organized now, it looks a hell of a lot more like that.

So meta today is organized.

There are centers of excellence across the company.

Same way that I was just talking about by dance.

There''s fair.

That''s the fundamental AI research team.

There''s infrastructure shared across the whole company deployed to all the products and apps.

There''s revenue and monetization shared across the whole company deployed to all the products and apps.

there''s growth shared across the whole company, deployed across the various products and apps.

There''s integrity and safety, which is a big, big, big advantage that Facebook has.

They''ve reorganized how the whole company looks.

There''s still all the individual products in the family of apps.

Those all have their own heads, and they all roll up to Chris Cox who has had a product for the whole company and AI too, actually reports to him.

But all the infrastructure, all the revenue, all the growth, all the integrity and safety are decoupled from those actual products now and live in these centers of excellence across the company.

Fascinating.

And I think there''s a lot of bite dance influence in that.

Makes sense.

It''s the most formidable competitor they''ve ever faced and they really have no way to neutralize it.

Yep.

All right.

So all this talk of TikTok, them being an AI first company clearly met at today is an AI obsessed company.

How did that start?

Well, that is a great question, Ben.

But first, we''ve got a brand new partner to announce that we are very excited to share with you all.

Huntress.

Huntress is one of the fastest growing and most loved cybersecurity companies today.

Its purpose built for small to mid-sized businesses and provides enterprise grade security with the technology, services, and expertise needed to protect them.

Yes, they provide a revolutionary approach to managed cyber security that isn''t only about tech, it is about real people providing real defense around the clock.

So how does it work?

Well, you probably already know this, but it has become pretty trivial for an entry level hacker to buy access and data about compromised businesses.

This means cyber criminal activity towards small and medium businesses is at an all-time high.

So listeners, Huntress created a full managed security platform for their customers to guard from these threats.

This includes endpoint detection and response, identity threat detection and response, security awareness training, and a revolutionary security information and event management product that just launched.

Essentially, it is the full suite of great software that you need to secure your business plus 24-7 monitoring by an elite team of human threat hunters in a security operations center to stop attacks that software-only solutions can sometimes miss.

Huntress is democratizing cyber security by taking security techniques that were historically only available to large enterprises and bringing them to businesses with as few as 10, a hundred or a thousand employees at price points that just make sense for them.

In fact, there are over 125,000 businesses now using Huntress, and they rave about it from the hilltops.

They were voted the industry leader in endpoint detection and response eight times in a row and the industry leader in managed detection and response by customers in the G2 rankings for the second time this summer.

So if you want cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions backed by 24-7 expert humans who monitor, investigate, and respond to threats with unmatched precision, head on over to Contrist.com slash acquired or click the link in the show notes and just make sure to tell them that Ben and David sent you.

Okay.

So David met it today clearly an AI obsessed company.

How did that start?

Yeah.

So I mentioned this organization fair a couple of times.

I think it''s fair to go back and tell the actual origin of that because it''s really interesting.

Hey, it''s fundamental AI research.

Originally, it was Facebook, AI research, and now it''s fundamental AI research given the company is now met up.

So back in like 2013 timeline, when the company was finally fixing mobile coming out of the hellscape of 2012 of going through that transition during the IPO and the shift to mobile, Mark and the company''s VP of engineering, Mike Shrepfer, or Shrep, as he''s known, we''re trying to figure out like, okay, we''ve finally got a little moment to breathe here.

The Tiger isn''t chasing us at the moment.

Can we take a step back and try and figure out like, when is the Tiger going to jump out next and try and get us?

Yeah, or all these crazy things are happening because we''ve been having to play defense as user attention shifts with this new paradigm of mobile.

How do we not let that happen next time?

Like how do we play a more active role in whatever the future of technology is?

So we''re not getting whiplashed around and we can kind of control our own destiny a little more.

Yeah, basically not actually owning the platform sucks.

We''ve realized this now.

How do we make sure this never happens again?

Yes.

And that spawns some of the early work on AR and VR.

Come back to that in a sec.

And even this early in 2013 on AI, an AlexNet had just happened right at this time.

And for whole history of AlexNet, go check out our Nvidia series where we talk all about that and the importance to AI and ML.

And Facebook actually had a small ML team already at this point.

They were mostly doing computer vision.

The early machine learning folks at Facebook were mostly looking at, can we do automatic image tagging to reduce the, you remember how cumbersome it used to be when you''d upload a big batch of photos, then you had to go tag every single one.

And then somehow magically, I don''t remember the exact year, it was like all pre-suggested.

And you were like, whoa, this is pretty cool.

That was what the original ML folks at Facebook were doing.

Yep.

And Alex net and those big AIML breakthroughs in that era, where we''re all around image recognition.

And so Facebook was kind of already attuned to this.

So like, oh, okay, there''s like some pretty big technological stuff happening.

Maybe this is gonna be like the next platform vector of the future.

We should get serious about this AI stuff.

Yep.

So summer 2013, Mark and Shripp go out to recruit Jan LeCoon and convince him to come start an AI research lab at Facebook and Jan was then and is now one of the top AI luminaries in the field, top academics out there.

And Jan says, like, well, I''m flattered that you would want me to come work here.

That''s interesting, but like I live in New York, I teach at NYU, I don''t wanna leave, I don''t wanna quit teaching at NYU.

And I''m pretty darn committed to open source and publishing all the work that we do.

And Mark and Trevor are like, one, sounds good, you can stay in New York.

two, okay, you can stay at NYU, two, three, yeah.

We love open source.

We were built on the lab stack.

Great, publish everything.

We even talked about this at all at this very long episode so far, but Facebook had been doing a ton of open source publishing in basically everything they were doing.

They were open sourcing things like Cassandra and their back end, they were open sourcing front end frameworks, both on mobile and on web.

React, react native, yep.

Exactly.

They''d been open sourcing a lot of the language modifications they were making.

I don''t think open compute had started yet, but that was right around this time where they were starting to open source their data center designs.

Data center architecture.

Facebook definitely has a very particular open source strategy that we''re going to talk about an analysis, but needless to say, they have been advocates of open source since the very beginning.

Yeah.

So, Jan is like, wow.

Well, okay, when you put it that way, sure.

And what''s really important about how they do this is this is not Microsoft research.

This is not Blue Sky.

Yeah, let''s go focus on anything.

This is a highly focused AI research group.

We are going to research AI.

And I think that has kind of made all the difference.

It is super clear exactly how that is going to translate into helping Facebook and Facebook''s products.

This was pretty, I don''t want to say contrarian, that would have been wrong.

But it''s one of a dozen specializations of computing that you could have sort of glimpsed into for the future.

Yep.

And it was one of those earned secrets that Facebook had and Google had And at this time, you know, 2013, 14, 15 of like, oh, we can very, very profitably apply this work to our current products in social media feed recommenders.

Yes.

So it''s very funny that the rest of the world is having their AI moment now, because Meta had theirs in 2013, 14.

Before language models, like long before LLMs, Facebook realized they could profitably spend billions of dollars on AI systems to recommend A, what post you should see next in your feed, and B, what ad out of the entire inventory of ads we could show you.

What is the best one for you at this moment in time for that advertiser spend?

And today, there''s a lot of companies who are spending on AI in hopes that the use case materializes in the future.

Facebook''s is like wildly proven and has been for a decade and is incredibly profitable for them.

So that''s just like something to keep in mind whenever you''re looking at Facebook talking about AI today.

Yeah, there''s a lot of future-looking stuff they''re talking about, but it is already super at scale and a great business and has been for a long time and they''ve just been, you know, it''s like they''ve been quiet about it, but no one cared until now.

It''s one of the fundamental advantages that Facebook has today relative to all other AI companies is that they are guaranteed profitable ROI on all of their AI spend, all of their research, all their infrastructure, all their GPUs, they have highly, highly profitable ways to put it to work today.

It is a nice to have for Meta if the next form factor of computing is an AI assistant like Meta AI, but it''s not essential.

That''s one of many things that they could do profitably with AI technology.

Yep.

The other thing you got to remember is 2012 Facebook.

Look, their engineering brand still wasn''t top notch.

Like everyone knew that they were a up-and-coming, great startup that went public.

But they weren''t necessarily reputable in the computer science community as these people are Microsoft level researchers to advance the state of the art.

Or Google level in the way that Google always was from the beginning.

Yes, and I think Mark and Shrepp had to make this point to Jan, and then when Jan joined, it kind of made the point to the rest of the industry that this is not something that''s going to like wax and wane with our financial results were in for a decade on this particular area of research.

It''s kind of amazing.

It really only took like two years to bear fruit for them before they had profitably deployed AI systems in production, because most of the time these research projects take much, much longer.

It''s funny actually, thinking through this now, I think they''re three dimensions to the payoffs from this investment in AI and fair back in 2013.

One is the near term and immediately an ongoing profitable paybacks to incorporating AI in existing Facebook products and social media feed recommenders.

Highly, highly, highly profitable.

It just makes every ad that''s displayed more likely to make money and it makes every feed post that is displayed more likely to get engagement.

and yes, 100%.

Okay, then there''s two, which is this like, hey, AI might be the next computing platform.

There''s a lot of interesting stuff going on.

This allows us to have a piece on the chessboard and be a player in the next platform transition.

Should it be to AI?

And this is just like what Meta did with threads, with WhatsApp, you know, with threads, they''ve said we''re not monetizing it right now.

We''re gonna see if it becomes a big close to billion user platform.

And if it does, then great.

We''ll figure out the right monetization strategy, just like we did with WhatsApp.

It may or may not be ads specifically, but we build things that get engagement, and then we later figure out how to make money on them.

Yep.

And then three, they had no way of seeing this at the time.

But fair and AI actually becomes the way that they can catch up and re-architect to compete with TikTok via reels.

Yeah.

You know, no AI, no reels.

That''s such a good point.

If not for fair, TikTok could have disrupted Facebook.

Totally.

I mean, Reels would not have come out as fast as it did.

Right.

Facebook would not have had that near-term weapon to go, huh, we need something that kind of stops our users from leaking out and jumping over to this other app, you know, for a use case that we basically can''t match.

I mean, it is magic how the Reels and Tiktok algorithms work and now YouTube was short that very quickly they do figure out how to put things in front of you that are incredibly engaging just for you.

I mean, they call it the for you page.

And that have no social connection to you?

Yes, exactly.

You''re right.

The decision looks more pressing than ever given that.

Totally.

Okay, so that''s fair and AI.

Let''s jump forward now to 2016, 2017, 2018.

And I think for our purposes here today, it''s interesting to view the 2016 election, Cambridge Analytica, all the follow-up that comes out of that, which much, much, much ink has been spilled, through this lens of the consumer social transition from town square to living room.

Cause I think it actually explains a lot.

Oh, all right.

I''m curious to hear what you''re thinking here.

But to catch us up, here''s kind of what happened.

And until 2015ish, Facebook could kind of do no wrong, other than all the data privacy issues that they had sort of worked through with the FTC in 2011.

But they are now increasingly finding themselves in very controversial situations that they are ill prepared for as sort of all of humanity is now joining the network.

First of all, content moderation is becoming an issue.

Oh, yeah, for sure.

Facebook is trying to figure out their role in this.

Are they a neutral platform?

Do they need to kind of police what is said on their platform?

On top of that, actually defining what is allowable speech on their platform is becoming trickier than ever.

And it is hard to create one set of rules and abide by them globally.

And Facebook was just caught flat footed in a big way by the fire hose of questionable content that people would post.

Ultimately, they end up throwing huge amounts of people at this hiring tens of thousands of contractors to deal with content moderation, building out really sophisticated kind of policies and programs and escalation and review processes.

They have an ever escalating set of posts, videos and live streams shared around the platform.

That''s right, because it''s not just text anymore.

It''s obviously photos, but like videos now too.

Reviewing real-time video, absolutely.

And as you would imagine, they are not perfect at this.

So they''re creating headlines left and right about objectionable things being shared on the network.

In building technology that enables everyone around the world to communicate with each other and organize, they also have the flip side of anyone can share anything.

And if it''s engaging enough, there''s a ton of eyeballs that see it.

So misinformation is starting to become a big deal to ultimately, this comes to a head in the 2016 to 2018 period after they have whittled away.

a lot of the public''s goodwill, and we''re just gonna zoom in on this moment for the company.

The 2016 election happens, and a lot of people are looking around for an answer to, wait a minute.

Yeah, this isn''t the outcome that I expected.

What happened?

Exactly.

There''s a lot of people who feel this couldn''t have happened on its own legitimately, somebody did something.

And one thing that absolutely did happen is there was a firm called Cambridge Analytica that sold their services to the Trump campaign and had a methodology to create psychographic profiles that they believed would work that were derived from a Facebook quiz application.

This ends up being an absolute honey pot of a story for anyone who has fired up about a big change to the country that they are not excited about.

Yep.

And so, there were basically four stories concurrently happening of how Facebook was involved in the election.

One, there was Russian interference.

Two, people are spinning up fake news sites, not necessarily for politics, but actually for the ad dollars generated on them.

Three, Cambridge Analytica.

Four, the Trump campaign may have been really good to using Facebook''s digital marketing tools.

Yes, I think that is like undeniably too.

Yeah, so there''s been years of investigation into each.

It seems like that last one is actually the biggest lever.

Yes, Russians did spin up fake pages and accounts with pretty modest spend.

And people absolutely spun up fake news sites and generated fake viral stories for politics and also profit.

Cambridge Analytica, yes, it was a thing, But they ended up with actually pretty crappy derivative data from a quiz, not the treasure trove of raw Facebook data on you and your friends that everyone feared.

But David, to your point, really what happened is the Trump 2016 campaign just actually took Meta platform seriously and got really, really good at using the tools.

Yeah.

Quite ironic in that Obama totally doubled down on Facebook as a strategy and used it to great effect to win the 2008 and 2012 elections.

Yes.

So as you can imagine, I''m preparing for this episode and I''m like, okay, I just heard Mark Zuckerberg say on another podcast by a great interview with Alex Heath at the verge after Meta Connect about this.

He dropped this line.

People thought that all this data had been taken and it had been used in this campaign and it turned out the data wasn''t and the data wasn''t even accessible to the developer.

So David, I''m listening to that And I stopped because I''m thinking, well, that''s not what anybody thinks because there was a ton of reporting on the fact that they did.

So what actually happened here?

So here are the chain of events.

Back in the 2010s, Facebook built the platform that we talked about that was incredibly permissive in the early days when you authed your profile against an app.

You gave it all of your profile data.

And in those earliest days, it could actually see your whole friend list too.

Facebook eventually made their API much more closed off, but it took a couple of years to do that.

Now, there was a terms of service that required app developers to delete any data they had after a period of time and only use it for very specific purposes.

But of course, Facebook couldn''t actually guarantee that people were complying with the terms of service.

It was just, you know, you are a breaching contract.

So at some point, a developer made an app that was a quiz.

Users could opt into taking that quiz, the quiz asked you questions, and by combining the answers to those questions with the profile data you authenticated from Facebook, that That app developer then tried to label you with a pretty basic psychographic profile, and then ultimately that derivative data, the labels of personality characteristics that were derived from Facebook data and your quiz answers, is what Cambridge Analytica had, as best I could tell.

So I read a good amount of the report that the UK government put out about this.

The conclusion was that the quiz was taken by 320,000 people since those people had access to friends, the total surface area was the public profile data of 87 million Facebook users.

They also found that Facebook had requested that Cambridge Analytica delete all the data, both the actual Facebook data and anything derived from the Facebook data back in 2015 before the election even started.

So it was, yes, true.

An application got access to Facebook data on a lot of users is also true that it violated terms of service to use that data for other purposes and they did not comply with a delete request or they may not have complied.

It''s kind of difficult to reconstruct.

On top of all this, it supposes that Cambridge Analytica''s method of taking these quiz answers and translating them into something that could impact voting worked, like it was effective.

And that''s pretty thin.

Right.

That''s kind of the most thin thing of all of it.

Right.

So here''s what the UK report concluded.

And this is in government speak.

So it''s all very hedged.

While the models showed some success and correctly predicting attributes on individuals whose data was used in the training of the model, the real world accuracy of these predictions, when used on individuals whose data had not been used in the generating of the models was likely much lower.

Through our analysis of internal company communications, the investigation identified there was a degree of skepticism within Cambridge Analytica as to the accuracy or the reliability of the processing being undertaken.

They''re appeared to be concerned internally about the external messaging when set against the reality of their processing.

So at the end of the day, the Cambridge Analytica thing in particular was kind of a nothing burger.

But that is not the story that gets told.

The UK regulator was given full access to this and it ended up being quite skeptical that the methodology even worked in the first place.

So they''ve got this like kind of crappy derivative data, not complying with terms of service requests to delete it, and the method may not actually work.

Now, this doesn''t exonerate Facebook in any way from what could have happened.

They had an incredible treasure trove of data that apps could slurp up in the early 2010s, but the actual narrative of Facebook data that Cambridge Analytica had impacted election results is like wildly oversold.

Yep, all that aside.

As we were waiting through all of this and trying to make sense of it and think about how we''re going to talk about this unacquired, there is such an enormous, enormous disconnect between reading what actually happened and then how people felt and what the like lived reality of the brand impact on Facebook was, which that was huge.

Yeah.

Nothing could have been huge.

To me, the story here is there sure was a lot of ill will and discontent with the Facebook brand that people were willing to dive in headfirst on.

It''s almost like Facebook isn''t guilty of whatever the heck people think happened with Cambridge Analytica all these years later.

But something is very, very wrong that like hundreds of millions of people believe that.

Yeah.

And it''s not just wrong with the system.

They definitely, in behaviors along the way, I managed to earn people''s distrust.

I think that''s the issue.

So let''s bring it back to my supposition here, which is that I actually think this paradigm shift that Mark identified from town square to living room was way more right and way more powerful than even he realized.

And this is one of the second order effects of it.

The quiz that was the app on Facebook, that happened way back in the early platform days.

is totally solidly in the town square days.

And then the election happened in 2016 when things are already starting to transition, what''s up exists, snap exists, snap has launched stories, Instagram has now copied snap and launched stories in that very same year.

Two more years go by, the Cambridge Analytica news doesn''t actually hit until 2018.

By 2018, we are solidly in the living room era.

So, all of the supposed real or imagined impacts of this Cambridge Analytica thing had their roots back in the town square era.

We''re now here in the living room era, and that is what people''s expectations are of Facebook, of social media, of everything that they are sharing in their lives.

And I think this is, to my mind, at least, where the disconnect is.

People''s expectations shifted.

But now, all of a sudden, all this stuff in the past becomes really, really relevant to the present.

And when you look back at the past through this lens of what the present is, you''re like, well, this is really effed up.

Like, how the hell did the company do this?

Right.

And, you know, the answer was they were trying desperately to grow.

They were trying to will a platform into existence.

Of course, the cultural norms were a little bit more permissive, but like the cultural norms were really never permissive to the point to say, sure, you should download and store a big JSON dump of my whole profile information and any pages that I like and anybody whose names I''ve connected with like that always was probably a little bit of an overstep but then once developers were able to do that and then violate terms of service and store it forever then it just kind of becomes this like ticking time bomb that''s out there exactly it''s like this weird temporal and cultural like mismatch of it all landing in 2018 when the world is a very very, very different place.

In part, you know, you can see why Facebook massively prefers the ad-base business model of, we never even expose any information to you, advertiser.

You target, and then we just deliver the ads.

You never get to know anything about who the users are on our platform.

We don''t sell data.

Like that is a true fact whenever they stand up there and say, we don''t sell data.

They don''t.

They sell the opportunity to target users, but in fact, if they did sell data, it would be a bad thing because someone that could then build a competitor.

Like the asset that they have is actually their data that they choose not to sell four business reasons.

Yep, totally.

Then there''s this whole other layer to here of like, well, why did they do this in the first place?

Why did developers have access to so much data?

They were building platform.

They were building an entirely different business with a different strategy.

Now they are an advertising and media-based business.

We''re almost talking about two totally different companies here as I think we''ve told in the story.

Yeah, I do think when I search my heart of hearts, though, when I was developing apps in the 2010 period and would let people use Facebook Connect or whatever the current branding of accessing Facebook accounts was at the time, I was always like, whoa, this is a lot of data that comes with someone clicking that button.

Well, I think you made the point right of like, Facebook had to kind of sell the platform to developers.

Totally did.

They didn''t have the underlying hardware and technology and operating system to offer.

So there had to be a really big sweetener.

Yep.

I just can''t believe it though.

After all these years and all this writing and all these headlines, if Cambridge Analytica were more competent, they probably could have had more impact.

But as it stands, I just can''t believe there''s not a big story on the front page of major newspapers with big headlines saying, actually, Cambridge Analytica didn''t really have that much in the first place.

Their methodology appears to have not worked, and Mayacolpa, sorry for getting y''all all riled up.

If you don''t want to like Facebook, sure, but go pick a different reason.

Okay.

So what happened with all this?

It is worth knowing to finish the story earlier from the consent decree in 2011 that said Facebook is going to be carefully monitored for privacy concerns.

As you can imagine, the Cambridge Analytica News coming out, put a gigantic bullseye on Facebook, and the FTC said, aha, you guys signed a consent decree a mere seven years ago, what the hell?

This is exactly what we''re talking about.

And Facebook just decides, you know what, what''s the big dollar sign that we can check that we can write here?

Because it seems like we just want this to be done, we want this to be buried.

We''re a different company now, we kind of want to put that to bed.

The whole settlement here was not specifically about Cambridge Analytica.

There were a bunch of other things that are privacy related, but the number is $5 billion.

And, David, there is one thing that it comes with.

And that is a 20-year window that they are monitoring Facebook.

And that is exactly matching to the words that Mark gave us on stage that Cambridge Analytica, the way they handled it was a 20 year mistake.

Yep.

Now, I think by the 20 year mistake he met much more of like the damage to Facebook''s brand.

Yes.

That came out of this.

Yes.

And specifically the FTC settlement.

Yep.

It is funny.

I was thinking this is a very Facebook appropriate comment.

If we had sub titles for this episode, this one would be it''s complicated.

I guess so great.

It really is.

It really is.

It really is.

And what it comes down to is I think there is an ethos at Facebook that at many steps along the way, there was an opportunity to grow, to win, to compete.

And what mattered was winning and then when the dust settles, you can kind of look around and say, okay, what was the impact of that?

That is one way to run a company.

The other way is to be really careful and ask permission.

Facebook fell into the first camp and they probably wouldn''t be here today or certainly at least wouldn''t be a global player with four billion users today if they hadn''t fallen into the first camp.

But by falling into that first camp, you have stuff that comes up where you''re like, ah crap, I wish we hadn''t done that.

And this is one of them.

Right.

The time bombs totally.

Okay.

So what actually happens?

Facebook becomes a lot less valuable after all of this comes out.

The company announces in their July 2018 earnings call that they''re going to be more focused on user privacy and that revenue may slow as they make this intense focus.

They dropped 19% in one day.

They wiped out $119 billion in market value, which was the largest single day loss for any company in history at that time.

At that time.

Save at that time.

Yeah.

To be exceeded in the future.

So this whole privacy issue, the $5 billion settlement, all this stuff that just happens with Meta, it has big ripples for the whole tech industry.

There''s a phrase that is known on the lips of every American, somewhere in the neighborhood of Cambridge Analytica, election interference, fake news, I hate social media, Facebook did this, YouTube did that, blah, blah.

And this is a persistent drumbeat that is underneath the whole national discourse.

There is an opportunity to be the anti-Facebook here, if you want to be, to be the company that says we are so unbelievably incredibly about privacy, even more than we ever have been before.

David, who does that?

That is Tim Cook''s Apple.

Yes.

So Apple, a company that I love in a door and was actually wearing an Apple T-shirt earlier today and had to take it off before recording, because I felt like it was weird to be wearing my Apple T-shirt when recording the Facebook episode.

Apple is a company that has always been incredibly privacy conscious.

They both use that as something they believe deeply in their soul and design into their products and is amazing for all of us who use their products to get that privacy and have that trust.

They also, to use Ben Thompson''s parlance, use it as a strategy credit.

There are areas in which it really behooves them because they don''t need to do server side stuff.

They don''t need to do advertising because they make a lot of advertising indirectly from Google and they don''t need to do a lot of other things.

So they can tout.

Hey, we''re unbelievably secure with your data.

We take privacy incredibly seriously.

No one takes it more seriously than us.

They start really beating this drum and by 2021, they decide, you know what?

In iOS 14.6, we are going to launch a new policy called app tracking transparency.

Yep, ATT.

And what that means is a few years ago, we mandated that anybody who is tracking you across apps start using something called the IDFA, the identifier for advertisers.

Now in the past, Apple had let you just actually reach in and grab the device''s unique identifier, which was pretty cool because as a developer, it was unrelated to advertising.

Think of it almost like a serial number of this device.

And you could use that for things like, hey, is this the same user across multiple applications?

I''ve got my SDK and my code running in multiple developers'' applications, so I can do interesting things like say, hey, this person both takes runs with Strava, and they also use Google Maps, and you can just kind of gather data across apps.

Kind of similar to how Facebook was gathering across the web with like buttons everywhere, or with Facebook connect everywhere, so they could build this holistic profile of things you do off of Facebook.

So Apple stops letting you use the device identifier, they force you into using this IDFA.

And then with iOS 14.6 in 2021, they say, hey, if you''re using IDFA, part of that API is that now whenever someone launches an app for the first time, it''s going to ask them in this really aggressive language, are you okay with getting tracked?

Or do you want to ask this app not to track?

What do you think people are going to click?

Yeah.

There''s a default answer to that question.

Yes.

So what actually ends up happening, most people click ask app not to track a whole lot of Facebook''s targeting basically falls apart.

They no longer have a picture of you outside of apps that they actually own.

And a lot of the reason why advertisers can get so good at targeting is because of this holistic picture that is built for you across your phone.

David, this is the example kind of manifest in practice of the thing you were talking about all the way at the launch of mobile of what''s one of the reasons why Facebook''s beautifully constructed business model doesn''t work in the mobile walled garden ecosystem.

It''s because the operating system maker can make a change like this that just kind of affects core functionality that you were relying on.

Now you don''t have access to that data so you can''t run as effective of an advertising service.

Totally.

And a minute ago when you asked the question of who is banging the privacy drum, and I said, it''s Tim Cook''s apple.

One of the reasons I said that is that, actually, I didn''t know this till doing the research, Mark and Steve Jobs had a great relationship, which makes this story all that much more interesting.

Mark is very Steve-like.

Very, very Steve-like, and they actually met for the first time in 2007.

Right as all of this is coming together, and the first meeting was that Steve actually reached out to Mark and wanted to meet him and build a relationship, which I don''t think Steve did that with too many people.

And then so on the back of that, the next year in 2008, when the iPhone SDK was launching and people were building apps, Mark and Facebook actually go to Apple and meet with Steve and they pitch Steve on exactly what you were just talking about then like, hey, how about you let us bring our platform that we''ve just built that has all these developers into you iOS into your platform.

Really, oh, to make Facebook platform part of the iOS developer, whoa.

Yes, which, you know, from Facebook''s part is kind of like a Hail Mary.

Like, yeah, they''re probably not gonna say yes here, but this is really big risk to us.

We might as well try.

But they did have enough of a relationship where Facebook and Twitter both were privileged citizens on an early version of the iPhone OS.

Like in the settings screen, even before you installed any apps, there was like a Facebook and a Twitter settings for, I guess, like, native integration between the operating system and those networks.

And social networks, yes, totally.

So Steve, supposedly the legend goes, you know, Mark and the Facebook team make this whole pitch and at the end of it, Steve just looks at Mark and it''s, you know, like, all of us a little sheepish and it''s', '2024-10-31 05:21:26', '2024-10-31 05:21:26');

' that has all these developers into you iOS into your platform.

Really, oh, to make Facebook platform part of the iOS developer, whoa.

Yes, which, you know, from Facebook''s part is kind of like a Hail Mary.

Like, yeah, they''re probably not gonna say yes here, but this is really big risk to us.

We might as well try.

But they did have enough of a relationship where Facebook and Twitter both were privileged citizens on an early version of the iPhone OS.

Like in the settings screen, even before you installed any apps, there was like a Facebook and a Twitter settings for, I guess, like, native integration between the operating system and those networks.

And social networks, yes, totally.

So Steve, supposedly the legend goes, you know, Mark and the Facebook team make this whole pitch and at the end of it, Steve just looks at Mark and it''s, you know, like, all of us a little sheepish and it''s just like, thank you for, we''re just not going to let somebody else build a platform on top of our platform.

And then he sort of pushes back in his chair and it''s like, clear that''s the end.

And then he''s like, hey, so by the way, what do you guys think about Microsoft and working with them?

And then they just like have a really nice conversation supposedly for the next couple of hours and shoot the shit and talk about Microsoft and computing history.

It''s this very cordial relationship.

And I think the sense I get is that Steve really liked Mark and respected him.

Well, they''re both like pretty product visionaries and they''re both like very stubborn about their views of the future and they both were very right about their views of the future.

I can see it.

Totally.

And clearly, that is not the feeling today between the two companies.

And I think what happened since, okay, if it had just ended, Apple isn''t going to let Facebook build a platform on top of their platform, that might have been it.

But then when mobile app installs happened, and Facebook all of a sudden...

Facebook was making billions of dollars off of deciding what apps in the App Store get downloaded.

Apple had to have felt like, hey, this is actually...

this is our tariff ours.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And so then after everything that happened in 2016, 2018, Cambridge Analytica privacy, tier point, and part of this is that Apple has always cared about privacy and it''s always worked well for them and it''s part of their main product strategy.

Part of it too is like, oh great.

Here is kind of the ultimate competitive vector that we can have against somebody we really don''t like who we feel has profited off of our platform unfairly.

Yeah, you end up with Apple feeling like everything that happens on our platforms is ours.

And these are our users to protect.

And no one''s going to do wrong by our users in any way.

So you have Apple who is protective as all hell.

And then you have Facebook where Mark Zuckerberg, more than anything in the world, wants as much freedom to operate as possible.

And you have Apple trying to constrain and you have Mark who hates feeling held captive.

Yep.

So now here we are in 2021 and Apple''s like, we''re making our move.

Yeah.

Facebook''s been reeling.

We''ve been beating the privacy jump for the last couple of years since 2018 and Cambridge analytic.

Now it''s time to make the move.

So what ends up happening?

Actually the first couple of quarters, not much.

Facebook''s talking about our earnings calls, hey, we think this is going to have impact.

It''s not huge.

But then, February 2022, which is technically the end of year 2021 earnings call for Meta, they drop the bomb, interestingly in question and answer.

I listen to the whole earnings call and the CFO kind of casually says in a response to someone, oh, we think that the impact from ATT to our ad business will end up costing us on the order of $10 billion for 2022.

What?

That is eye popping.

like, uh, okay.

So what ends up happening is there''s a 26% drawdown in a single day.

Remember we said to put a pit in the, uh, single day drawdown records.

The market cap went from 900 billion to 700 billion.

The actual number is they lost 232 billion in market cap.

The new largest in history is surpassing their previous record.

And also, on this call, they announced their first ever quarter over quarter user decline.

Keep in mind what''s happening is on top of meta basically saturating most of the internet connected world by this point, TikTok is also really, really peaking.

So we''ve had some marginal users kind of using the app less because they''re moving to TikTok.

And Facebook is reacting to TikTok and trying to put reels in so they''re cannibalizing their own revenue by encouraging people to watch these short form AI recommended videos that actually don''t yet monetize as well as the newsfeed.

There''s just kind of three fronts that are destroying them here.

There''s ATT, there''s TikTok competition, and they''re making revenue cannibalizing changes in their own app.

So the hit continues.

It traded all the way down 46% by April 27th.

And then ultimately, it bottomed on Halloween that year.

So this is what eight months later, with a 72% drawdown.

Ooh.

They lost 72% of their value between February and Halloween.

Ooh, all in the year 2022.

It''s crazy.

And that is like Nvidia levels of drawdown back in the crazy Nvidia journey that we talked about.

It''s totally insane.

The interesting thing is, at this time, the real threat wasn''t actually ATT.

The biggest of those three threats was TikTok stealing users.

Yes.

The whole ATT thing is about how much money can we make off of an ad because it is so well-targeted.

It''s an optimization that is useless if you do not have users to advertise to in the first place.

Yes.

So the actual real existential threat is TikTok, and Ben Thompson makes this really great point, and I know I''ve quoted Ben over and over this episode, but I think he''s just been so astute on Facebook at many points throughout history.

This decision to make these product changes to respond to the TikTok threat in the face of ATT to do these at the same time is a founder-led decision.

If you had a professional CEO, the correct thing to do to preserve your job and shareholder value is to wait 6, 12 months before you start reacting to TikTok to let the whole ATT thing blow over.

Mark''s like, I can''t get fired.

I think the right thing to do is react to TikTok now because every day this problem compounds and gets absolutely worse.

I don''t care that there''s this horrible narrative going on right now with ATT that is going to cause us apparently to lose $10 billion of revenue.

We otherwise would have gotten this year.

We must cannibalize revenue you in addition to that to make these product changes.

What it ends up with is a 72% drawdown and what it also ends up with is the chance for it to 5x from there, which is what has happened.

The company saved itself by acting correctly in this and they had to go through this wild tumultuous two-year journey in the process.

It''s just another episode of Mark making these sets of decisions because he''s Mark because he controls the company and because he has the stomach to withstand it.

Yeah.

And what ended up actually happening from ATT?

It''s been value-destructive overall, because I don''t think the amount of money that has shifted away from Facebook has been captured by Apple.

I get the sense that the App install business for the App Store, those search ads is going great, but it''s not like equivalent to what the monetization over at Meta is on App install ads or was on App install ads?

Yeah.

I think Apple was sort of hoping in its heart of hearts that this would shift a lot of those dollars into ads in the App Store.

And the reality is people just don''t go to the App Store searching for apps anymore.

Not to mention this kneecapped meta on a lot of ads that are not App install ads.

This kneecapped a lot of the like we have a friend that''s in the retail business who was saying that their ads doubled in price in 2022 when this happened and they were sort of scratching their head and they have nothing to do with the App Store.

So all that kind of happened is that entrepreneur said, I guess I''m gonna keep advertising on Facebook as a platform, I hope it gets better.

I''ll pick some other platforms, but like I can''t advertise with Apple.

There''s nothing for me to do.

It''s a retail good, it''s a physical item.

So I guess I''ll just pay more money to acquire customers now.

Like an ends up actually hurting the business when go to market channels get less efficient unless you can sort of shift that spend to a place where your customer is also hanging out.

Yep.

In practice, Meta''s fine.

When a shift like this happens, the most scale player with the most engineers and the most data turns out they''re still the winner.

Meta launched this thing called Advantage Plus and now if you''re an advertiser, they use a whole bunch of other data signals and you still have a customer acquisition budget, you''re going to spend it.

You''re probably going to go spend it on Meta the same where you were before.

It''s just not quite as efficient as it was.

Oh, and by the way, anyone else that got hurt from the changes with ATT just doesn''t have the ability to react and build around it the way that Meta had because they don''t have the resources Meta does.

Yep.

So all of this finally brings us to the last piece of the story here that I''m sure listeners at this point you''re probably saying like what the heck or however many hours in you guys haven''t said the words reality labs or Oculus or AR or VR once oh is Facebook in that industry yeah yeah you know I guess they We are.

All right, so what happened here?

Way back in 2012, Facebook starts getting interested around the same time that they''re starting fair for AI and what is the platform of the future?

They start doing some hardware prototyping on their own.

They''re not really set up for that yet, but they do wanna do the same sort of approach that they did with AI, which is focused research, not general research, pick a particular thing where we have an opinion about something we think is gonna be the future and then invest deeply in it.

Yep.

So a crazy thing happened in February of 2014, they opened up the purse strings and paid $19 billion for WhatsApp.

They had so much conviction that the future was AR and VR that 34 days later, they paid another $2 billion for Oculus.

I had no recollection that these things were a month apart.

No, I didn''t.

I knew they were both in 2014, but I didn''t realize they were a month apart.

It''s wild.

I think Mark got the demo of Oculus and was just like, oh, this has the most credible potential to be the future out of anything that I''ve ever tried.

So yes.

But I think actually the right way to think about this is through the same lens as fair.

It''s a research lab in the same way that fair as a research lab.

And it was like, oh great, $2 billion to kickstart the research lab.

Fantastic.

All right.

So you and I have both tried Orion.

It is unbelievable, fantastic, very clearly a path to the next generation of computing device.

I don''t know if this is going to be the winning company.

I don''t know if that''s going to be the exact winning device.

But like, never have I been so sure that a mainframe very far away from me to converting to a PC which lives three feet from me, converting to a phone that lives in arms length from me.

the next logical step is glasses that live on my face.

And I used to sound ridiculous, and then you and I tried Orion, and now I''m like, oh, yep, that is going to replace or augment my phone in whenever these things are commercially available and consumer grade.

I''m glad we waited to do this episode because I think I would have had a pretty different take having only tried VR headsets and Vision Pro and big goggly things over the years.

I think I would have been unconvinced, And frankly, because I didn''t think it was possible to put something in that small of a form factor.

So that is the current product experience that you and I have recently had.

Now let''s look at the business strategy and the financials of how we have gotten here and why.

So there are two ways to look at reality labs.

The first way is to answer the question, what would have to be true about the business to be great on its own and justify all this investment?

And let''s level said on how much investment has gone into it.

Yes.

So based on their spend already, since they started reporting reality labs as a separate segment in 2019, they''ve spent right around $60 billion.

That is in operating losses for the segment.

And does that include the $2 billion for Oculus or, I mean, either way, it''s a rounding error.

Who cares?

I don''t think it does.

With that level of investment, it already needs to be essentially the most successful and profitable consumer product in history to pay itself back.

That is the only possible outcome here where we even get our money back.

I know this sounds wild, but like that is the bet no other outcomes are acceptable.

Fortunately, if we want to model this out, we know the financials of a product like that, the most successful and profitable consumer product in history, the iPhone.

So, as a thought experiment, what if Meta managed to launch such a product, say the Orion glasses tomorrow, and say that such a product grew at the exact same rate and with the exact same profit stream as the iPhone?

Well, I did that napkin math, and if 2024 this year was Apple''s 2007, so you just take all the iPhones cash flows and you start the clock right now, Meta''s cumulative cash flows from reality labs, would be net negative until at least 2035.

Okay, okay.

So we''re talking in 11 years.

You would get back to break even on your investment 11 years from now.

If starting tomorrow, they manage to create the most profitable and widely adopted product in human history.

Which obviously is not happening tomorrow.

That also assumes generously that Meta could build a services business attached to it the size of Apple''s services business, which probably generates right around an equal amount of profit.

So basically, take all the profits from iPhone and double it.

That''s actually what you would need.

It''s actually fair to attach a similar size services business.

I think that''s very fair knowing Meta and all of its capabilities and everything that we just talked about.

Yes.

That is the bet.

Let''s just be super clear.

Anything else is a complete incineration of cash.

Well, okay.

That is the bet looking it through the lens that you posited of a purely financial investment perspective.

The second way is actually kind of financial too.

I think there''s probably a third more emotional way.

The second way though is if you''re Mark and you constantly live under the thumb of platform control, you do almost anything to get out of it.

That''s not irrational.

I mean, Apple made a $10 billion dent in their revenue just two years ago with ATT.

And I mean, they could, I don''t think they would, but they could at any given moment just pull you out of the app store and you''d have little recourse.

That is a existential business risk.

And it''s an unlikely one, but every day you could wake up and all of your access to all Apple customers could be over.

Which by the way, we haven''t talked about it, but Google could do the same thing.

Google could totally do the same thing.

They have the right to distribute or not distribute.

Anyone''s app in their store at any given time and look at Apple and Epic with Fortnite.

Totally.

So there is actually an expected value calculation you can run, which is my entire company''s market cap times the likelihood that it could happen, which, you know, it''s extremely low likelihood, but because the market cap is $1.5 trillion, the expected value is still a very big number.

So then if you''re thinking this way, what is a reasonable percent of your market cap to invest every year in a hedge, that might, might get you out from under the thumb of big tech platforms.

And at meta being worth 1.5 trillion, if they''re spending 15, 20 billion a year on reality labs losses, that''s a little over 1%.

Right.

Is that worth it?

If you truly believe that this is the most effective way to offset your most existential risk in the next two decades, It''s, hell yeah, it is.

Hell yeah, it is.

Now, am I certain that this is the best way to hedge that risk?

No, I don''t know.

And like, is there a huge amount of execution risk along the way?

Well, they''re running many hedges on this, of course.

I mean, this is part of what fair is.

This is what Lama is, et cetera, et cetera.

But it''s a 1% tax on your, I mean, it''s generous to frame it off of market cap.

You probably should frame it off of revenue.

But still, a 1% tax off of your entire enterprise value every year, eh?

I think there is also potentially a third way to frame it, and it''s funny.

I think you put it in the emotional lens.

I actually think less emotional, but more upside oriented of Facebook did have the taste of being a platform for those couple of years there from 2007 to call it 2010, 2011.

And if they own the next platform, not only will they do everything that you''re just talking about of like, oh, they''ll have an iPhone size business because if it turns in to be glasses and reality labs, they''re going to be selling the hardware and maybe they can make that profitable, like the iPhone is profitable, et cetera, et cetera.

Then there''s also your point number two, which is like, this is a defensive play.

Our core business right now is at risk because it''s built on somebody else''s platform and Mark made the comment on stage with us that they''ve run the analysis.

They think they could be twice as profitable in their core media products if they were on their own platform.

Sure, great.

But then there''s like the big, big play is the third part of like, well, what if we actually built a platform again where we have millions of developers who are developing on us and we are participating in their business in the way that we used to participate when they were developing on us in the past?

That''s an even bigger play.

And to underscore your point, David, just a few weeks before we recorded this episode, Meta held a multi-hour keynote at Connect in September 2024.

And of those multiple hours, zero minutes were dedicated to their core products of social media apps, their $100 billion business of selling advertisements on these social media products.

So at least with developers, it''s not about any of that at all.

literally the entire keynote.

Yeah, I did.

It''s great.

It''s MetaAI, it''s the Lama models underneath it, it''s the open source strategy, it''s developers building for the quest, it''s announcing new products, like the next iteration of the Reban Meta glasses, it''s revealing Orion, zero minutes to their current products or business, and they''re one of the biggest businesses in the world.

Yeah, wild, right?

They are all about this platform future.

So here we are trying to make the case of like they did it, they decided they were an ads business and they built one of the two greatest advertising systems ever known to man and one of the most amazing business models ever and At their annual developer keynote.

They''re talking about how they''re going to one day become a platform company There we have it That is the story of meta.

I should probably say for a minute here too my experience using Orion, you were talking about yours a minute ago, I thought it was unbelievably compelling and before trying it, I never would have believed that any type of AR or VR would really have been the platform of the future.

And then after trying Orion, I was like, oh, yeah, I could replace a lot of what I do on the phone with just these lenses being in front of me all the time and it would be way more efficient and way more enjoyable.

I would never have guessed that in this year you could fit that into glasses.

Glasses and a wireless puck.

Totally.

Yeah, listeners we never shared our impressions on this.

It is wildly compelling and if you asked Mark, he probably would frame this whole thing differently than we have.

It''s not about this hedge and he would say some things about platform control.

But I think for him is just this general belief that we want to make awesome products.

And I believe there''s an awesome product to be made here.

And I''m going to assemble the best people I can to go work on it.

And I think that''s the like most interesting duality of this company is it''s both.

It''s what is the best strategic move to make to Marshall Y resources.

And a much more touchy feeling like I want to make products that are great and bring people closer together, because that''s the mission of the company.

Yep.

Well, well put, should we wrap the story there?

We should.

All right.

So we will catch you up on the business today, just to put some numbers to all of this, and then we will move into analysis.

So as of the end of reporting last quarter, there are 3.3 billion daily active people across the whole family of apps.

Okay.

Estonishing.

That''s up 7% year over year.

The family of apps revenue per person is about $12.

The end of year stats from last year when you just look at the Facebook app, not the whole family of apps.

The daily active users are 2.1 billion.

So of those 3.3 billion daily active people across all the apps, 2.1 billion are on Facebook.

book.

And the monthly number of Facebook is 3.1 billion monthly active users.

So 2.1 daily 3.1 monthly.

Wow.

What''s happened in Instagram are in the neighborhood of 2 billion monthly active users.

What''s app has a hundred million now in the US, which this is sort of a big narrative violation that what''s Apple never catch on in the US and nine messages dominant and even after that, it''s, you know, text message.

This is crazy.

100 million people a month in the US use WhatsApp now.

I mean, it''s been a slow burn over time, growing and growing and growing, but to me that kind of came out of nowhere.

The other narrative violation here, there actually is a lot of growth among young adults using the Facebook app itself in the US.

I think a lot of people think that''s a sort of boomer thing.

It''s funny.

One thing that may be contributing to that, which we didn''t put in the stories marketplace.

I mean, for me personally, Oh yeah, I have totally boomeranged all the way back around on the Facebook blue app and I am now a loyal DAU Because of marketplace.

It''s awesome Which is crazy because you don''t use any other form of Social media besides like posting on Twitter for acquired right correct They''ve announced that meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant by the end of the year It''s worth disambiguating meta AI from llama llama is the name of their family of open source models Those models do power meta AI, but meta AI itself is a branded consumer experience that lives both standalone and in a bunch of meta''s apps.

Their revenue in 2023 at the end of the year was $135 billion, operating income of $47 billion.

So that''s a 35% operating margin worth knowing, just like all tech companies, they have become CapEx heavy the last few years.

They now last year spent $28 billion in CapEx, which you should mostly read as data centers.

They operate a hyperscaler-sized data center footprint give or take.

You know, you think AWS, Azure, Microsoft, and Google Cloud.

Meta is the fourth one.

They just don''t sell it to anyone else.

It''s only consumed by internal teams.

So huge amounts of investment in AI hardware and just other data center expansion.

The balance sheet is fortress.

They have 50 billion in cash and 58 billion, including cash equivalents and marketable securities.

They have 71,000 employees and their market cap is 1.5 trillion up from 230 billion in just October of 22.

Wow.

Incredible.

Totally incredible.

So two really insane observations about the state of the company today.

All of their products seem to increase user engagement over time.

And all of these products have different use cases.

And it happens across geographies.

There is something in the water at this company.

Why is it that WhatsApp and Instagram are both increasing in user engagement over time.

It''s the growth function.

I mean, it''s this like purpose built heat seeking missile of attention and metrics that the company pays attention to, where across a whole broad product suite, engagement increases.

It''s not like they have one thing that happens to do really well.

It''s a process.

I would say it''s a whole set of things as these, you know, the company calls them centers of excellence internally.

It''s the growth function.

and it''s AI, it''s the ads and the revenue team.

All of this contributes to it.

Yep, fair.

The second insane thing at IPO, the US and Canada market had an average revenue per user of $11.

That number is now $227.

Wow.

Yeah.

And globally that average revenue per user, when you include all the emerging markets and less valuable markets for them is $44.

dollars, so they really, really monetize now.

So how much of the world does Meta really have left to kind of put a bookend on this?

I almost asked you this question all the way in the beginning when you were teeing up the episode, but I''m glad we''ll save it for here.

So according to the UN, last year there were 5.4 billion people online.

This includes China.

Right.

So they''re basically saying two thirds of humans are online.

And Metta does not include China.

Yes.

Metta has four billion monthly active people across the family of apps.

China alone is 1.4 billion.

And while this isn''t like totally exact, I think you just apply the same multiple to China and say, well, two thirds of humans are online, two thirds of China is online.

So that means that there''s 940 million people online in China.

I mean, that''s probably being conservative.

I think you could probably argue a much higher percentage of China is online.

Yeah.

But let''s be conservative.

That leaves about 450 million people, or 6% of the human population who have access to the internet, but are not yet metta monthly active.

That doesn''t mean they''re not metta users, that just means they weren''t monthly active users as of the end of the last reporting period.

So metta''s addressable users who aren''t yet users is less than 6% of humans.

to the wild, to the wild, and then still I think the craziest thing about the company is that if you look at the daily active user figure, it''s not that much lower.

Right.

And across all products.

And so once you frame it this way and you''re like, huh, there''s only 6% of the population left either through reactivation or signing up that they could get.

You sort of understand why they put so much effort behind emerging markets, It''s behind doing things like zero rating, doing custom deals with telcos, rolling out fiber, bringing countries online for the first time, even when they have no near term monetization potential, internet.org was the name of their initial for a long time around this to basically say, look, we are saturating humans, we gotta figure out how to get more humans on the internet.

Yep, move on to analysis.

Yep, okay, so in the analysis, the first thing we''re gonna do is power and then playbook.

So we are going to do a seven powers analysis of what enables Meta to achieve persistent differential returns or, you know, to put it another way to be more profitable than their closest competitor and do so sustainably.

This is interesting.

Who is their closest competitor?

I think that''s probably worth defining first and foremost.

Ultimately, they are in the business of selling advertising.

So I think their closest competitor is Google.

Yeah, they are certainly the most similar looking businesses in their current forms.

But like, who do they compete against for the same profits or the same potential profits?

Right.

I''m not sure that it''s actually Google.

I mean, it almost certainly is YouTube within Google, but I actually think it is other social platforms.

Yeah, you''re right.

I suppose it''s other places people spend time.

Yeah, it''s where people spend their time.

Right.

online and offline.

Right.

And I think really what has to happen here is an analysis of each set of stakeholders individually.

Like you almost kind of want to do a seven powers analysis on the user side also of why would someone pick a meta product over a snap product.

And even though they''re not voting with dollars, it''s almost like their attention is a proxy for dollars because you just assume that those companies should do a comparable job monetizing the attention.

Yeah.

But what makes sense I think is to just walk through each of them.

So counter positioning, they probably don''t have much counter positioning in the current state of meta and hold on AI for the moment.

In their startup days, they did a lot of counter positioning against other global social networks.

By being a college only authenticated social network, they were accepting lower growth, they were accepting a cap ceiling of number of users, and they were doing that because they wanted to make the trade that they felt, you know, a closed community is more important.

Yeah.

With higher engagement, scale economies, scale economies, 100%, absolutely.

This company''s in the business of scale economies.

Yes.

And I think that scale economies on the infrastructure side, on the GPU investment side, I think that scale economies on the advertiser side and on the ad experience side, like just by having so much more scale, they are the default standard way to spend money for advertisers.

Think about on the tooling side.

Think about the experience of being an engineer at meta and the thousand engineer years of work that comes out of that company every year on making the developer experience of working there better.

I mean, it''s crazy with the revenue scale that they have, how much they can amortize these fixed costs.

Totally.

Everything at this company is scale economies.

Yes.

Okay, scale economies for sure.

Switching costs as a user.

You''re pretty locked in once you have followers.

Oh, I hadn''t thought about that.

Yeah, that really speaks to, again, you know, another shift we didn''t really talk about in the evolution of what we call social media is the creator aspect of all of this.

The whole idea of like a creator an influencer didn''t exist in the early days of social media and Facebook.

But now you and me, our platform on the podcasting platform, like we have a credible switching cost.

Somebody who has a ton of Instagram followers has incredible switching costs.

Yep.

Now, fortunately, in the land of creators, you don''t actually need to switch.

It''s just an end.

Yep.

You know, it''s not like you''re ripping out one vendor and putting another vendor in.

I do have a sunk cost in building a following on a given platform, but that doesn''t actually prevent me from also launching on another platform.

If you have the time to kind of do that.

Yep.

I think there might actually be process power.

Normally there''s not, but I keep kind of going back to this like there''s something in the water.

Their products grow in engagement over time.

Their growth team does 10,000 little things to open up every step of the funnel as wide as it can be and make the most frictionless fluid experience for users.

Interesting.

Yeah.

I was actually having this discussion with Hamilton and recently about the difference between process power and cornered resource, and a good test for this is when you bring somebody brand new into the organization and plug them in, does the power transfer to them as well?

If no, then it''s a cornered resource.

If yes, then it''s process power.

In this case, I think that''s potentially true.

Yeah, you can bring in new engineers, you can bring in new product people and transfer the advantage to them.

You know, for a while, they had legitimate process power in how they shipped.

I mean, Statsig has started on the premise of this.

It blew my mind when someone from Facebook came and gave a talk at Microsoft in 2014 on how they ship product and how it rolls out and not only the feature-flying elements of it, but they can sort of like watch performance, auto-roll things back if they''re causing a negative performance metrics.

how there''s just deployed code all the time with a whole bunch of experiments turned off, how there''s these experiments that are running in different ways in different markets, and they can statistically significantly disentangle which results are from which experiment when they have multiple experiments that are concurrently running with the same user base.

I mean, that was like real voodoo that only Facebook did for feels like a decade.

Yeah.

And I suppose Google probably does similar type things in different ways, but nobody else really does.

I think OpenAI kind of does.

I think OpenAI has so much former Facebook DNA and kind of thinks the same way that I think they do a lot of this sort of thing too.

Yeah.

Okay.

I can buy that there''s some process power here.

Yeah.

Branding.

Branding is such an interesting one.

I mean, can they have negative brand power?

Yeah, right, anti-power, branding weakness.

There''s no love for the brand meta.

There''s no love for the brand Facebook.

There is love for the brand Instagram.

Yeah, but diminishing as it gets larger.

Certainly not like it once was.

Yeah, there''s like reliability with it all.

Like I feel pretty, I mean, there''s branding that comes with being any big company that you''re sort of like large and trusted and institutional.

Yep.

But no, I think this is a clear example of how strong the other powers in this company are that, like, despite the brand taking a 20-year hit in Mark''s parlance, they''re still today, you know, one and a half trillion dollar company.

Yeah.

And then, cornered resource, unless you''re going to call Mark 1, which always feels a little bit too cute to name the founder.

I actually think there are some cornered resources here within Meta, and ironically, I think one of the biggest ones is the integrity and safety team and all of the privacy controls and work and security that they have done.

That they''ve had to harden over the years, yeah.

Yeah, even though this is also the source of so many criticisms about the company.

It''s now pretty robust.

If you think about anybody that would start up to try and compete with them, somebody I was talking to put this to me, like, imagine a startup trying to build a hate speech classifier in Farsi, Metta''s got that.

And trying to have the relationships with the public policy people in 200 countries to understand what is acceptable speech in each of those countries.

Yeah, so while probably, you know, YouTube to a certain extent TikTok, perhaps also have similar strengths here, I doubt there is any other company in the world capable of actually operating privacy, integrity, and security.

And within that is also anti-spam stuff too, which is super, super, super huge at the level that Facebook is.

Hmm.

It''s interesting.

Okay.

So in looking at this, why does Meta do $47 billion a year in operating income and why do we all believe that''s going to continue for a while?

Like what actually is the defensibility here?

Is it the network economies because they''re so tautological that I mean, I would argue it''s not that because what we''ve seen is TikTok showed us there''s a way without initial strong network effects to go capture people''s attention and thus eventually the add dollars.

Yes, and they competed very successfully with Meta in doing so.

Yeah, if this were five years ago, I would have been like, why even talk about the rest, network economies?

Once you have the network, then, you know, it doesn''t the rest doesn''t matter.

That''s just not true anymore.

Yeah.

Well, I think the network economies are still true relative to anybody who would compete in a social product, which still exists.

Totally.

Social is just now divorced from media.

Right, and most people do use both and sometimes they even use different apps for it But it''s two different modes of let me it may be the same session on the couch But you do need both use cases of show me who the people that I intentionally follow What they''re doing and then show me entertaining things.

Yeah So part of their business is defensible from the network economies But the other part honestly it kind of feels like habit Well, habit, but I think scale economies are really big for that too, especially in AI.

I think the only way that this new paradigm exists is because of AI and because of GPUs specifically.

And I''m not even talking about generative AI.

I''m talking about like feed recommender systems and personalization systems.

And so like there is a very, very large minimum barrier to entry there that keeps going higher as bite-dance and better keep investing in it.

Yep.

That''s a great point.

Okay.

Okay.

Playbook.

Playbook.

Let''s do it.

Okay.

So let''s talk about what Meta is doing with AI.

And that will lead us into our first playbook theme because we''ve talked about so far, the beginning of fair, them starting all this AI research, the early 2014 on use of feed recommenders and the AI for the ad matching system.

' it kind of feels like habit Well, habit, but I think scale economies are really big for that too, especially in AI.

I think the only way that this new paradigm exists is because of AI and because of GPUs specifically.

And I''m not even talking about generative AI.

I''m talking about like feed recommender systems and personalization systems.

And so like there is a very, very large minimum barrier to entry there that keeps going higher as bite-dance and better keep investing in it.

Yep.

That''s a great point.

Okay.

Okay.

Playbook.

Playbook.

Let''s do it.

Okay.

So let''s talk about what Meta is doing with AI.

And that will lead us into our first playbook theme because we''ve talked about so far, the beginning of fair, them starting all this AI research, the early 2014 on use of feed recommenders and the AI for the ad matching system.

But there''s a lot going on with Facebook and AI right now that we really haven''t talked about.

So there are two words for you to know.

One is llama, and this is the family of foundational models that Meta has developed.

And these are competitive with open AI and Anthropics Claude and Google Gemini, etc.

Yeah, and then there''s Meta AI and Meta AI is a consumer brand that is the way that you interact with Meta''s self-hosted version of Lama or maybe give it a little bit more greens than that.

It is an application that Meta has that uses Lama in the background but provides Meta-specific AI experiences.

Some of them bundled into apps like in WhatsApp chat or in Instagram.

The blue app or whatever, yep.

Yeah, but also there''s a meta AI website that you can go to and interact with it directly.

But Lama is the models themselves, meta AI is the consumer product.

And Lama, they have spent billions and billions of dollars, huge amounts of R&D, huge GPU clusters to train big data centers.

Interestingly, it is all open source.

So Mark makes a big deal about this.

Yes, it''s interesting to sort of think about why.

It''s not open source in the same way, really, that Olinix is open source, and this is the free standard that everybody uses, and there''s just sort of a foundation behind it all.

Meta is putting huge amounts of capex and Opex, like huge amount of dollars, into willing llama into existence.

It''s very different than these sort of cheap grass roots, open source projects of the past.

Yeah, it''s open source like Android is open source.

Yes.

And so why are they doing this?

Well, if you ask Mark why they have an AI model at all and I''m quoting from a great blog post that he put out about this, we must ensure that we always have access to the best technology and that we''re not locking into a competitor''s closed ecosystem where they restrict what we build.

Okay, I understand that.

You believe that the most important thing is to to control the key technologies that make your products possible.

Okay, that last bit is important.

Basically, what Mark is saying here is, we''re gonna spend a lot of money training these foundational models, but unlike all of the competitors in the AI space, we actually don''t have a business model around making money on this.

So we''re gonna spend all the money, we''re gonna give it away for you, why does that make sense?

It''s open compute project all over again.

Yes, so for anybody who''s not familiar, Facebook made this move in the early 2010s where they realized they were spending tons and tons of money on their data center infrastructure.

And the vendors who they were paying these integration partners and the server companies and the networking companies were making fat margins.

And they were thinking, this is dumb.

We''re a really big customer.

Why is everybody else making so much money on us?

And they looked around and they saw all these other big data center companies and they''re like, Like geez, all those people are paying big margins too.

What if we just publish the specs for the billions of dollars of work that we have done to make our data centers?

And then we start this thing called the Open Compute Project.

And we just get a bunch of other people to adopt it too.

Well, suddenly, then the Open Compute Project is this standard by which all the hardware manufacturers and integrators actually have to snap to because all the customers are saying, this is what we want.

And it''s a pretty genius way to drive margins down for these suppliers.

And also a way to guard against somebody in your supply chain kind of building platform power.

Yes.

So what they basically learn from this is, oh, we open source this thing.

A lot of our costs went down because the whole ecosystem started using the thing that we open sourced.

So even though we''re not making money, you know, they''re not a cloud company, they''re not selling access to their data centers to anyone.

Right.

They''re not a hyperscaler.

It pays back in the form of saving them money.

It can do the same thing in AI.

They publish a really expensive open source foundational model that is in the conversation to be as good as these other closed source ones.

Well now, there''s a lot of developers out there who are just going to build on the open source free one.

It kind of becomes something that the community can build on and improve and make better.

As Mark said in our conversation with us on stage, there''s a lot more smart people outside your company than inside it.

But effectively what it does is it puts pricing pressure on the AI model companies.

To the extent that Mark views it as a super important key ingredient to the product experiences he wants to build in the future, it''s super bad if there''s a few close source providers who can provide that experience and they a lock him in to controlling, so here''s what you can build, here''s what you can''t build.

But B, take his margin, basically say it''s really expensive every time you want to make a call to one of our proprietary services.

When you think about it, it''s actually a form of operating leverage, where he''s basically saying there''s a big fixed cost I''m willing to bear in order to bootstrap this ecosystem and commoditize all of these compliments, commoditize all of these other closed source AI models, and in exchange what I''m going to get for that is just pricing pressure on all of them so that in the future, my variable costs are lower.

I just get to keep more of the dollars that we bring in rather than having to pay them out to proprietary model providers in the future.

It''s a pretty novel business strategy.

Yeah, totally.

So I said commoditize your compliments.

This notion was dreamed up and named by Joel Spolsky in 2002, where there''s a great blog post about it.

And he makes this analogy, think about cars and gasoline.

these are compliments.

When sales increase in one, sales increases in the other.

You have a car, you need gasoline.

Well, AI models end up being a compliment to Metas products in order for them to build better AI or even the feed recommendation stuff we talked about.

They need best-in-class AI models.

And just because cars increase the sales of gasoline, that doesn''t tell you about how profitable an automaker gets to be versus a gasoline maker.

So imagine the automaker decided that that they want to get into the gas business so that their customers could have access to low-cost gasoline or even further, let''s say the automaker decided to make low-cost gasoline just to drive all the other gasoline prices down while gas is cheaper and you''re the automaker, you can actually charge more for cars since consumer willingness to pay is around the total cost of ownership not about a car or gasoline specifically.

Right.

As a consumer, you''re always buying a solution.

You''re buying transportation or you''re buying a technology product doing a job for you, and if AI is a required input to that solution, then like, yeah, you''re thinking about that as a total purchase decision.

Yes.

Or an advertiser is not going to pay you more or less depending on how much you have to pay the AI model provider.

They''re going to pay you an amount, and if you want to maximize the amount of that you get to keep, it behooves you for you to not have to pay as much money to AI model providers.

years.

Yes.

Better put.

Okay, so how does this apply to playbook?

Well, Meta seems to like taking all the risk in situations like this, putting lots of dollars in so they can take more of the reward.

You can imagine a more moderate company saying, oh, well, there''s going to be lots of AI vendors out there.

And we could just let them take care of that as their core competency.

And we''ll just buy off the shelf from them.

But that''s not how MetaWorks, especially with everything they''ve been through with Apple, they have gotten true religion.

And I think always kind of wanted to be in this position and they just have the capital to do it now.

They will control the key technologies that matter to them, both for getting to own and dictate product roadmaps and products decisions, but also for the financial upside of making sure that they control their own destiny and no one in the ecosystem has extreme leverage over them.

Right.

Only a company of the scale of meta can kind of run this playbook, playbook in quotes, because no startup is going to be like, oh, okay, what is my strategy to make sure that OpenAI and Anthropic don''t get leverage over me.

Good luck with that.

Yep, totally.

So my first big playbook theme is meta discovers commoditize your complement and is now looking for ways to use it everywhere.

I love it.

Well, but okay.

Great.

I think my first one is almost a different way of putting that, which is really like Mark and specifically his superpower of placing multiple bets on multiple chessboards.

Never wanting to be backed into a corner.

And I think he has done incredibly well.

And I think the story of Meta shows all throughout, even in the very, very beginning as a tiny project, not even a startup where degrees of freedom were limited.

He was always making choices and playing the game such that there were multiple options of how things could go right.

Totally.

Mark is a master at maximizing his degrees of freedom and setting up the board such that in an uncertain future, there are multiple paths to victory no matter how the world unfolds.

Yep.

Which is unbelievably gatesian.

I feel like we said the exact same line about Bill Gates in our Microsoft episodes.

The real comp for this company is Microsoft.

I think that''s right.

That was actually my next one.

They do iterative product development.

They put the first version out just to kind of get feedback and see how they need to rev it and get better for the future.

The early days are characterized by hiring all the smartest people and prioritizing IQ over everything else, commoditizing your compliment, obsession with building a platform that other developers build on top of this whole thing about multiple bets in an uncertain future.

I mean, it''s funny that just look at they were building messenger internally, they bought WhatsApp.

I bet they''re glad that they had that dual prong strategy.

They were developing an app called Photos at the same time that they bought Instagram.

That''s what they do.

It''s Gatesian.

And the most interesting thing that I think is like hit me in the face like a ton of and the shift in public perception and having to do all this testifying is like watching an alternate future for Microsoft where Bill Gates had decided to stay at the helm instead of leaving after the DOJ case.

That is the biggest difference is they both went through this hellish period, and Mark came out of it and said, I''m more bought in than ever, and Bill came out of it and said, Steve, you''re the CEO now.

Yep, it''s exactly it.

Yep.

Are you going to talk about Mark''s amazing line from the Harvard CS50 lecture in like 2005?

I''m not, but lay it on me.

Oh, it''s so great.

Mark''s what?

20 years old at this point maybe.

He spent the summer out in Palo Alto.

He gets invited back to do a guest lecture as like a practitioner in the field at Harvard CS50 class.

And he''s talking about product strategy and he He talks about how he really admires Microsoft''s product strategy and he thinks it makes a lot of sense of the first version is getting something out there and it''s usually not very good, but by the third or fourth version, it''s pretty darn good and that makes a lot of sense to me as a good product strategy.

It is amazing.

He lays it out right there.

We don''t have to like speculate it is explicitly stated.

In the same vein, it is painfully obvious when you look at this company that companies are just founders extended.

The culture of this company is just Mark, and it''s a huge lever for Mark to act.

This has been true over and over again, Microsoft, Nvidia, Nike.

It''s just how great companies are in the world.

It''s very hard for me to point to a truly great company where the DNA isn''t like a lever on the founder''s personality.

I think that is right, and I think it is doubly so with Meta because of Sean Parker and because it was set up from the very, very beginning that nobody could ever get rid of Mark, that it was always going to be his decision.

And there''s got to be a lot of companies out there that like we''re looking at the success case.

Yeah, this works if the founder is really, really, really smart and right almost all of the time.

Right.

As we talk to people here are the traits that we heard over and over again, Mark is a genius, a really good listener, a fast learner.

He goes from knowing zero to mastery in months or years.

He has low ego about being right.

That''s not to say that he has a low ego, but he has a low ego about being right.

He is obsessed with finding truth and open to being wrong.

He''s intensely competitive, he''s relentless.

He''s actually a very good product designer and understanding the computer architecture that will be required to accomplish such a product experience at scale.

I mean, all these things like if you have these characteristics and you''re then empowered to singularly control the company at massive scale, yeah, it''s going to go well.

But the first thing is actually much harder than the second thing.

Yes, yes.

It''s not a causal relationship here that having founder control will lead to the right decisions.

Right.

This is my regular reminder that in studying these episodes with extreme survivor ship bias, we are looking at the most extreme outliers who in every dimension you could multiply by there at the edge of the distribution.

Mark is, I don''t know, six or seven standard deviations from the mean human across the important traits that mattered to making Facebook.

Oh, and by the way, with the right timing and the right luck and the right circumstance and the right know how my biggest lesson from doing acquired is these things are unrecreatable.

Yeah.

Agreed.

All right.

What''s your next one?

Durable executive team.

It''s kind of shocking how many of the people that are Mark''s direct reports and their directs have just been there for a really long time.

This team knows how to work together.

Oh, yes.

I was actually talking about this with one of the execs at Meta the other day and he brought this up and was saying that like this really feels like something very, very unique to Meta and I thought about it for a minute and I was like, actually, no, I think this is something that is unique to all great companies.

If you look across the landscape out there, Apple certainly like this.

If you look at Nvidia, if you look at Apple, If you look at, you know, Microsoft in recent years, if you look at the original Microsoft, you look at Costco, like this is almost always true, really is true in every great company that I can think of.

The core senior most executive team are all people who came up in the company or been there for a very, very long time.

It''s not a whole bunch of mercenaries there at the top.

Yeah, that''s interesting.

Okay, that brings me to this next one, which is something we talked a little bit about with Mark on stage.

I''m curious to hear your answer to this.

Now that we''ve had all this time and space to think about it.

Here are all the battles where meta has either one by buying the company, one by beating the company, one by copying or gotten to some kind of sustainable stalemate.

MySpace and Friendster, Google Plus, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp.

We didn''t talk about this one, but a mere cap and periscope.

Oh, yeah.

They launched Facebook live when that was supposed to be the next big thing.

Yep.

Snapchat and TikTok.

That''s like seven, eight.

Why do they keep winning?

I have some thoughts.

It''s funny.

As we were preparing to interview Mark at Chase Center last month, this was the question that we kept asking people.

Well, in some ways, I think it''s a little bit of a Rorschach test.

Everybody''s answer was different, and it was always like what they think is the most important thing.

I think my answer for this is going to be a version of Mark as the answer.

And it kind of goes back to Adam D''Angelo''s Friendster testimonial about him being way too lucky and then realizing it''s not luck at all.

And I think it is that, you know, as Adam was telling to me, as he''s reflected on this, it''s a very specific way of carrying yourself through the world where you don''t hold too tightly to the path you''re on.

Obviously Mark is incredibly driven to the goal of connecting all the people in the world and doing that through meta.

But he''s very, very open and flexible to like the exact path that it''s going to take to get there.

Yes.

And that combination, I think, has led over and over and over again to these threats emerging and Mark and the whole team there at meta saying like, okay, what is the way that we can neutralize this threat or defeat it?

And we are open to anything on that front.

And I think they are open to being whatever they need to be to make that happen.

I think Meta might look extremely different 20 years from now than it is today, almost like unrecognizably because this company moves like water in response to whatever the new shape of the world is.

I mean, hell, after trying Orion, I think there''s a very plausible reality five years from now where this company looks very, very different than it does today.

Yeah, I mean, it really is this idea.

Meta is a technology company through and through, and then they leverage that technology to be whatever the hell they need to be to adapt to the new world, which is so different from all of the other big technology companies out there.

They are all wedded to a particular vision of what they are.

Totally, because these are all different strengths, like they are in a freight of copying.

Okay, that is a strength, but that''s also a completely different thing than I''m going to place bets on what I think is going to be the big technology wave of the future and spend tens of billions of dollars on that.

That''s a different way of winning.

Or in some cases, I''m going to try to leverage my existing network effect to make sure I adopt someone else''s social mechanic.

Okay, that worked in a handful of these scenarios, but that''s not at all what works in others.

They don''t just have one singular playbook that they run over and over.

Right.

Right.

This company moves like water and product is an active discovery there.

I''m convinced it''s not pure invention.

You asked Mark that on stage.

And there''s some stuff they have to invent.

Like Orion, you have to invent.

But software where you can ship and quickly respond to user feedback and iterate, it''s like they''re chiseling away at the marble to find David.

I don''t think they have David in mind when they''re starting.

Most of the time, there are a few moments where they did.

Newsfeed is completely one of them.

Inventing the social feed is a completely distinct and brand new thing that Meta created.

It''s actually one of the few.

When I was a little bit more bearish on the future of reality labs, I was trying to come up with, has Meta ever successfully created something new that has become a profit center for them that is like not adopted from someone else?

Well, I think the tagging of photos was pretty novel.

Yes.

And newsfeed.

Yep.

But it''s like kind of funny that we''re naming those things as platform as short lived as it was.

No, that was a we wish we had an operating system, but we don''t.

So let''s see if we can convince people that this is a sufficient platform.

Well, I think building a real honest-to-god platform with hundreds of thousands, if not millions of developers, making money on it, on the open web.

Okay.

Fair pushback.

It was totally novel.

Like, nobody had done it without an operating system before, and like...

Maybe there was going to be a social platform in this new era.

Yeah.

Maybe that was an operating system of sorts, or on par with operating systems to be able to create a platform on top of.

But I take your point, it''s certainly not every turn of the game where they''re inventing.

They''re doing a lot of discovery here.

Right.

And maybe all companies do and, you know, there''s not something distinct to meta here and everybody learns from each other.

And that''s fine too.

But that was something that I was racking my head on thinking through.

In fact, there''s even a testimony, this is kind of funny, in the Mark Zuckerberg versus the Winklevoss case from way, way, way back one.

and Mark even makes some comment about, well, actually the idea for Facebook wasn''t even new because MySpace and Friendster existed.

So it''s like this interesting positioning of the whole thing itself is actually a borrowed idea, which of course served him well in that particular case.

But the point sort of stands is like, so much of this is borrowed, and we just live in a world especially in social where you do kind of have to just, maybe this is media as a whole, observe what the new format is and adopt it as quickly as possible.

Yeah, so speaking of trying things, I just wanted to take a moment to honor all the failures.

I kept a running list as I was doing my research on products that either died or just didn''t live up to the hype.

Facebook live, Facebook watch, the drone, the solar power drone that that they developed to provide internet access?

Oh, yeah, that''s right.

That was like a whole big thing for a while that, yeah, that''s right.

Mark was actually two for three on, he was forecasting like in 2015, what are we gonna be focused on 10 years from now?

That was one of them.

Or the other two were augmented reality and AI.

It was kind of an impressive call.

Portal, Portal TV workplace, which as far as I can tell, Facebook is the only company in the world that actually uses workplace, no other enterprises ever adopted it.

I''m sure that''s not like exactly true, but that feels approximately true.

Beacon, Facebook deals, which was their Groupon clone.

No, that''s right.

Think about how nimble Facebook is that they''re like, oh, oh, this social deals thing seems to be gaining traction.

Maybe that''s a core part of the platform that needs to be a piece of this in the future.

I mean, they just had zillions of these Facebook gifts.

You were gifting and you could use Facebook credits to pay for them.

Facebook book credits.

I mean, on top of Facebook credits, uh, Libre, oh boy.

Yeah.

Wow.

We didn''t even talk about that whole chapter on crypto.

Yeah.

They invented a whole new, you know, cryptocurrency and a big consortium around it and a huge set of investors and other Fortune 500s.

Originally, Facebook messages was going to be a Gmail killer.

You could email people into Facebook Messages and use that as an email suite, Facebook Places, when, I mean, four square was almost on par for a period of time with Instagram and Twitter as plausibly the next social mechanic checking in places.

And Facebook Places was a real effort.

Hey, now it just turns into tagging locations on posts, but like a first-class post in newsfeed for a while was a check-in on Facebook places.

Yep.

And then there''s all the independent apps.

Lasso, poke, slingshot, photos, hello, Facebook gaming, life stage, moments, notify, Facebook watch, moves, all the things they acquired, TBH, Beluga, they launched IGTV.

This company tries everything.

They move like water to discover what they need to be through an ever-changing environment.

So true.

All right, that''s it on the failures, what else you got?

Well, almost sort of the opposite of the failures, it''s quite ironic that Facebook became the prototypical startup, given that the goal was never to be a startup.

Yes.

The goal was first to be a project, and then to build a very profitable business.

The largest empire in the world, yes.

There was no in between of like, we are building a startup here.

It was like college project, oh, let''s connect all the people in the world and let''s get big really really really fast and skip this whole small company thing Right.

That''s such a good point.

And all this whole generation multiple generations now of startup founders that have really like Embraced and romanticized this whole startup thing on the one it like it''s great Silicon Valley so much bigger and there''s so much more investment and there''s so many more VCs and all that but it''s also just all kind of ironic that it''s glorifying this startup phase when that is not the point.

Deeply, okay.

So then we''ve touched on this one a bunch, but I kind of want to put a pin in it.

Why has Facebook always been in a precarious position?

Why do they need to keep fighting these existential battles?

Why are they so obsessed with building a platform?

I think the answer is they want to be as durable as a company that makes hardware with an operating system that all the users use and all the developers have to target because all the users are there.

I think that''s like what they really want, but because they''ve never had quite that much defensibility, you know, like, oh, a network effect is good, but it''s not as good as that incredible platform durability.

They''re always trying to expand and be more, every time they bump up against someone else, it kind of creates a problem for them.

And so I''m using a bunch of weird metaphors here, but it just seems like the place that they occupy in the technology stack is just not quite privileged enough to do the things that they want to do.

And so they''re always at the whim of someone else knocking them around.

Yeah, I think that''s right.

And it will be very interesting to revisit this again in five years or 10 years.

Yeah, part two and 10 years.

Yeah, right.

And then as we as we drift to a close here, where the engineering culture and being a technology company at their core has been essential.

Early on, they really did manage to hire only A-plus and then stay A-plus after that.

For ever and ever and ever, it was just this badge of honor if you were an engineer at Facebook for product design too.

I mean, they just had such a great talent density.

The set of things that they did on the technical side were over and over again a way to have their cake and eat it too.

If you can move faster, you can learn more through your multiple iterations.

And so speed of development comes from having great tools.

One very great, shiny example of this is something called hip hop for PHP.

Yep.

And this is very esoteric, but in the late 2000s, they had this crazy idea that what we should do instead of switching to C or C++ or Java, we want our engineers to keep writing PHP.

So they wrote a compiler to C.

So they didn''t have to take the performance hit from running PHP, which was an interpreted language.

But it also sculpted this like scalability problem because then they didn''t need to go hire all these systems level programmers.

They could hire web developers who wanted to move with that pace and flexibility while also having the infrastructure to run these massive systems and scale really efficiently.

And then that solved the scaling and performance problem.

But again, in 2014, they realized, oh crap, we''re big enough, and we don''t have enough sensitive data that we really should switch to a statically typed language, like Java or C sharp.

But again, they didn''t want to force their engineers to learn that.

They didn''t want to people who code in those languages have a different culture than existed at Facebook too They couldn''t really recruit people so they invented a new language called hack that was very similar to PHP But had static typing over and over again.

I mean Tao was another example this no-sequel database They just keep finding ways where they like invent new technology to solve a problem that probably only exists for them and then they create this like whole boutique system that allows a having one class talent, b, to have a ton of them, c, everyone gets to move fast, but then d, it''s all unbelievably performant and efficient and they just don''t have to make trade-offs.

It is wild.

Yep.

Okay.

Then my second technical one in addition to this is they are their own customer.

We''ve talked about this.

They''re a AWS scale technology company, but they don''t take outside customers, so they only have to build for their own internal use cases.

Now, this sounds great, but it actually does have these big trade-offs.

You can''t dramatically change what your infrastructure is used for.

It is purpose-built, but it does let you be incredibly efficient and have high performance if you have good communication between the customers, or the app team, or the backend service, and the designers of that data center.

This is completely the opposite of Amazon.

Amazon.

Amazon uses interface so teams don''t have to talk to each other.

At meta, they require incredibly tight communication.

It''s a very different organizational philosophy where they''re like, no, no, not only do we not have external customers, we want this insane-type coupling between our infrastructure and our internal customers.

Anyway, my last one, this is a company that grows intentionally.

It would be easy to look at this company and say, wow, what a viral product.

What a universally applicable product.

That is not the case.

It is unnatural to have connected four billion humans.

This is a freak of nature.

It''s not just something that people adopted.

And so while I think it is totally fair to say, wow, it just like blew up at Harvard, Facebook is the story of 50 different growth tactics in different eras all carefully constructed and iterated upon.

Weightless at colleges, strategically launching at every single college, picking each one for a reason, translation, internationalization, zero rating with carriers to bring new people online, figuring out when they need to do a choir versus build, carefully split testing every change, aligning the whole company on specific networks, on specific metrics, I mean, building relationships with governments in all these different countries and at the very least, complying with local laws on where should we have certain speech laws versus not?

I mean, it is completely unnatural for them to have done what they''ve done.

And it''s all been very, very intentional to connect the world.

Yep.

Okay.

Last playbook theme I''ve got, there''s always another battle for meta.

Yeah.

It''s funny.

I think you could be listening and think like, oh, yes, there''s always another platform battle ahead for a minute.

And that''s probably true.

But I think you actually mean like another societal battle ahead for a minute, right?

Totally.

Yeah.

Now that they''re through the user privacy issues and the many years of the whole 2016 election conversation we talked about and I''m not going to list them all here.

The many, many societal conflicts that they''ve had over and over again.

The current issue for them is around the impact of social media on mental health and in particular teen mental health.

Yep, totally.

And it feels fitting to put this near the conclusion of the episode because while going deep on this wasn''t a part of our understanding of how and why meta as a business works so well, it is a really important topic.

There''s a lot of people making arguments that social media is bad for our brains and the consequences if that ends that being globally true is catastrophic for meta.

Probably a bigger challenge than they''ve ever faced at any other point in history.

So if you''re asking yourself, what are the things to keep an eye on going forward for them?

It is of course all the product innovation and the growth of the existing business and trying to invent the next platform and everything we''ve talked about.

Orion and everything, yep.

Yeah, but it''s also how the mental health issue, understanding all that unfolds and how they handle it.

Yep, totally.

All right, time to land the plane.

Let''s land the plane.

How are you liking this, by the way, this land the plane way of finishing episodes?

Uh, well, I actually have a proposal for you Ben.

Ooh.

I don''t think we have landed unintended on the right nomenclature here or the right, um, construct.

So I actually, we''ve been calling this land the plane, take away the splinter in our minds.

Like, what''s the one thing that''s not going to round for you?

Yeah.

What is the essence of this company?

So I propose that we change the name of this final segment to quintessence.

What is the quintessence?

Yes, this is my inner French literature major coming to bear here unacquired listeners.

What is the essence of this company?

We''ve just spent all this time, all these months studying this company.

What is the very essence of this company that makes it different from any other out there?

All right, I like it.

The quintessence.

Ultimately, my big takeaway is the company moves like water.

It is the company that has connected the world that will always gear up for the next battle and be whatever they need to be in the next era, and whether it''s them defining the next generation of computing or creating all these AI experiences or fending off the next TikTok or the current TikTok, like they just move like water.

Yep.

I totally agree.

I can''t think of a better characterization of this company and how they got to be so darn important in the world, perfect place to end it.

And ultimately, it is still very much a Mark Zuckerberg production.

question.

Yes, that too.

All right, quick carve outs.

Quick carve outs.

My quick carve out is a Google product, actually.

Notebook LM.

This is freaking wild.

Our friend Ben Goin over at the Wall Street Journal who wrote the great piece on acquired a few months back texted us.

What was this?

Two weeks ago, maybe a week ago.

And I was like, have you guys tried this thing?

Notebook LM?

And I think you had me being me.

I hadn''t.

I was like, no, Oh, let me check it out.

I uploaded just the links to the sources that I used for my side of the research for the Microsoft Part One episode, just links.

And when it''s back back out of me, I was like, holy crap.

Yeah, at this point, I think we''re well-passed during test, but it is sort of the most convinced that something is actually a person I''ve ever been.

And if I didn''t upload all the sources and know that it was like unbelievably tailored content to the thing that I just uploaded, I''m not sure I would know that it was AI, it''s pretty amazing.

I have two.

One is a documentary on Netflix called Mr. McMahon.

I was not a pro wrestling person growing up.

I kind of want to go be a pro wrestling person now.

This documentary is incredible.

It is some of the best story telling I''ve ever seen.

And interestingly, it''s a documentary that is told with no narrator.

So there is story arc all throughout the episode exclusively with interview answers.

And you almost don''t notice at some point you finish an episode and you''re like, wait, there was no narration in that.

There was no cheesiness.

It was all first party accounts and then cuts to like old footage of things that aired on TV.

And then the credits come up and of course it''s a ranger production.

and Bill Simmons is the executive producer.

It is remarkable and Mr. McMahon is a singular figure in the world.

Certainly not to be glorified, but one to try and understand.

Oh man, be fun to do a WWE episode someday.

Yes, my second quick one is the Door Cache podcast.

I love the Door Cache podcast.

I also love Door Cache.

And I think that if you like this show, you''ll love listening to the interviews he does.

most recent one, or maybe a couple ago, is with Daniel Jürgen, who is the author of the prize, which is a book, David.

Yeah, yeah.

You and I almost read a whole bunch of it for Standard Oil, and then we realized the Standard Oil sort of over, at least the chapter of Standard Oil that we were covering within like the first two chapters of his book.

And so it''s basically everything from the end of our Standard Oil episode forward on the geopolitics of oil that ended up shaping and informing our world today.

And Dwarkash is just an amazing interviewer and conversationalist.

All right.

Well, with that listeners, a huge thank you to our partners, JP Morgan Payments, Crusoe, Statsig, and Huntress.

You can click the link in the show notes to learn more.

We talk to a ton of people for research on this one.

And while we can''t mention everyone, in part, because the list would just be too long, in other part, with some folks asked not to be think, we do have some specific ones that we want to give a shout out to.

' Oil episode forward on the geopolitics of oil that ended up shaping and informing our world today.

And Dwarkash is just an amazing interviewer and conversationalist.

All right.

Well, with that listeners, a huge thank you to our partners, JP Morgan Payments, Crusoe, Statsig, and Huntress.

You can click the link in the show notes to learn more.

We talk to a ton of people for research on this one.

And while we can''t mention everyone, in part, because the list would just be too long, in other part, with some folks asked not to be think, we do have some specific ones that we want to give a shout out to.

So Alex Schultz, the CMO head of growth analytics, internationalization, great to talk with Baws, Andrew Bawsworth, the CTO, Stephen Levy, who wrote the book Facebook, The Inside Story, was generous with his time Jim Breyer, who led Excel''s Series A investment in Facebook.

Jan LeCoon met his chief AI scientist Alex Heath at the verge for spending his time with me to friend of the show, Arvind Navarathnam from worldly partners who wrote an excellent research report, kind of chronicling everything.

Well, it''s almost like a written version of this podcast.

It''s like a hundred page PDF that was awesome to consume, kind of, to help me remember all the big beats of the story and that his research report is linked in the show notes to Ariel Zuckerberg, Mark''s sister, Cheryl Sandberg, obviously long time COO Mike Shrepfer, the former CTO and now senior fellow to Pete Hunt, early engineer who transferred from Facebook to Instagram post acquisition.

Naomi Glay, who we talked about, founding member of the growth team and the longest employee.

Longest 10-year meta employee at this point besides Mark.

Yep.

To Mike Vernal, former meta VP of Product and Engineering and former Sequoia partner Vijay Raji, former engineer and VP, now of course CEO of Statsig, a partner Romani, a VP in AI data and developer infrastructure at meta, to Owen Van Notta, Facebook''s early COO, and David, I know you have a few as well.

Yeah, a few for me to Adam Dandelo, obviously Facebook''s first CTO, Dan Rose, early partnerships at Facebook, and big, big final thank you that we owe to Chris Cox, Metta''s chief product officer and leader of the entire family of apps over there.

Really this whole past couple of months acquired would not have happened without Chris cold emailing us what about a year ago maybe and saying, hey guys, I love the Nintendo episodes.

And because of that, we met Chris and because of Chris, Mark joined us on stay to Chase Center.

And now here we are doing this episode.

So thank you, Chris, for making it all happen.

Yes.

Essentially, this episode came about because we had done too much research for the Mark interview.

And we were like, we probably should do the actual meta episode to listeners.

It is time for our acquired annual survey.

This episode is brought to you by AG1, an all-in-one daily drink to support better health and peak performance.

A drink I have not been consuming for the last few days because I''m traveling, and it''s the thing that makes me miss home.

I''m in San Francisco, allowing myself to be surrounded and inspired by some incredible software engineering that''s going on here, and putting all the other mess of politics and social bubble stuff aside.

So I''m doing a lot of programming and having a lot of really highly deep technical conversations, but I definitely miss Austin, I miss Texas, I miss Boston walking the halls of MIT, really is the university I intimately know no and there''s something about a university where you can shut off all the mess the outside world and focus on ideas on learning and on discovering plus the fearless energy of undergraduate and graduate students just boldly going forward thinking it can completely revolutionize a field.

That''s really inspiring to be surrounded by.

And in Texas, the thing I love the most is that there''s a simple kindness to the hello, to the nod, to the aimless and wonderful conversation that you might have at a coffee shop when you meet a stranger.

I don''t know.

I really fall in love with Texas.

And the long runs along the river, which I consume age you want after.

This episode was also brought to you by Nest Suite and all in one cloud business management system.

That''s the other thing about San Francisco that I''m reminded of, that there''s these incredible businesses that are born.

Just a couple of founders and they''re quickly hiring a few folks, especially engineering heavy teams and they''re all dreamers and they''re all pushing forward and they''re all trying to do the craziest shit they can.

Yes, there is a San Francisco bubble.

Yes, there''s a bit of a tunnel vision going on in many ways, but on the pure desire to build something cool Something that has a positive impact on the world.

I don''t know.

That''s a truly inspiring desire But of course sort of from my perspective I Share in that desire There''s a great cost to it as well, and it''s something that is a constant tension in my heart I would like to do more building than talking and I''m reminded of that what I''m here.

Anyway, there is a bit of a mess, a complexity, to the scaling of business, and the running of a business.

I''m reminded of the work and of my conversation with Carl Diceroth, a psychiatrist and a appreciator of the beauty in the world.

What a wonderful human being.

Also Paul Conti.

These are all friends of Andrew Huberman and what just deep and interesting people they are.

I would venture even to say very different, but both just incredible analysts of the human mind.

And what a mystery the mind is.

I''ve been reading a lot of mechanistic interpretability work, which is this whole field of analyzing your own networks and trying to understand what''s going on inside.

And there is just wonderful breakthroughs in that field.

But whenever I''m reading the papers, I can''t help but be caught by the thought that I wish we had this kind of rigor or the possibility of rigor in studying the human mind, sort of neurobiology and neuroscience is too messy, there''s too many variables, there''s too much going on and you can''t do control experiments like you can''t on your own network so anyway the human mind is a beautiful and mysterious thing and if you want to untangle the puzzles going on in there check out betterhelp.com slash Lex and save in your first month that''s betterhelp.com slash Lex.

This episode was also brought to you by Masterclass, where you can watch over 200 classes from the best people in the world and their respective disciplines.

Phil Ivy, I''m Poker, for example.

Great, great Masterclass.

There''s another guy who I don''t believe has a Masterclass, although he should.

Phil Humuse.

And I got a chance to meet him and hang out with him and it was, uh, what a cool experience.

I just love that this world can produce such interesting, distinct, unique characters.

And they are unapologetically true to themselves.

Beautiful.

I love it.

Anyway, there''s a lot of such characters on Masterclass.com, and you can learn from them.

So like I said, I love Phil, Ivy''s Masterclass, Aaron Franklin on BBQ, probably somebody I''ll talk to eventually.

They actually watch a couple of episodes of a barbecue show on Netflix, that''s pretty good, but not as good as in the masterclass I just love the science and the art that goes into the whole thing Anyway, get unlimited access to every masterclass and get an additional 15% off an annual membership at masterclass.com slash lexbod This episode is also brought to you by Shopify a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere with a great looking online store Before I set one up miraculously at lexfuman.com slash store, I think about the countless stores that are enabled.

I think about the countless stores that are enabled by Shopify and the machinery of capitalism.

And I was thinking about that when I was talking to Bernie Sanders and what a genuine human being Bernie is.

First of all, still firing on all cylinders in terms of the sharpness and the depth and the sort of the horse power of his mind.

He''s still there at 83 years old.

Still got it.

And also just has not changed for many, many decades.

I wish there would be more politicians with that kind of integrity, agree or disagree with him.

The man has integrity.

And as we head into this election, I think about the kind of politicians and human beings I would love to see lead our world.

And to me integrity is one of the character traits that is of the highest importance because the pressures when you are at the top leading a nation are immense.

And I would like someone who refuses to ever for any reason sell their soul for convenience or otherwise.

You have written and lectured about serial killers, secret societies, cults and intelligence agency, so we can basically begin at any of these fascinating topics, but let''s begin with intelligence agencies, which has been the most powerful intelligence agency in history.

The most powerful intelligence agency in history.

I mean, it''s an interesting question.

I''d say probably in terms of historical longevity and consistency of performance, that the Russian intelligence services, notice I didn''t say the KGB specifically, but the Russian intelligence services, going back to the Tsarist period, are consistently pretty good, not infallible, none of them are.

Of course, there''s a common Western way of looking at anything Russian.

Very often, I think it''s still the case, Russians are viewed in one or two ways.

either they are bumbling idiots or they are diabolically clever, no sort of middle ground.

And you can find both of those examples in this.

So what I mean by that is that if you''re looking at the modern SVR or FSB which are just two different organizations that used to be part of the one big KGB or the KGB or its predecessors, the Checa, you''re really going back to the late 19th century and the Imperial Russian intelligence security service generally known as the Okrona or Okronka.

It''s really the Department of Police, the Special Corps of Jean-Darms.

Their primary job was protecting the Imperial regime and protecting it against Imperial or other interior enemies.

Revolutionaries for part.

And they got very, very good at that.

By co-opting people within those movements, infiltrating and recruiting informers, agent provocateurs, in fact they excelled at the agent provocateur.

Person you place the site in organization to cause trouble, usually maneuver them into a position of leadership, and they provoke actions that can then allow you to crack down on them.

That is to many sort of lure or bring the target organization into any illegal or open status that it can be more effectively suppressed.

They''re very good at that.

So good that by the early 20th century and the years preceding the Russian Revolution in 1917, they had effectively infiltrated every radical party, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, SRs, great and small, and placed people in positions of influence and leadership.

So the point that arguably, that is, you can debate this, that I think in the whole, they could largely dictate what those parties did.

Nothing was discussed at any central committee meeting of any revolutionary group that the often had people in positions to influence what those decisions were.

Of course, that raises an interesting question, is that if they were that good and they had infiltrated and effectively controlled most of the opposition, then how did the regime get overthrown by revolutionaries?

The answer to that is that it wasn''t overthrown by revolutionaries.

It was overthrown by politicians.

That would then take us into a detour into Russian history.

but I''ll just leave it with this.

If you look at 1917 and you look closely, this is one of the things that I''d always tell my students, is that there are two Russian revolutions in 1917.

There''s the first one in March or February, depending on your calendar, that overthrows Nicholas II.

Revolutionaries are really not involved with that Bolsheviks are nowhere to be seen.

Trotsky and Lenin are nowhere to be seen.

They have nothing to do with that.

The has to do effectively with a a political conspiracy within the Russian parliament, the Duma, to unseat an emperor they thought was, you know, bungling the war and was essentially a loser to begin with.

And it was a coup d''état, a parliamentary coup d''état.

The temporary or provisional government that that revolution put in power was the one overthrown by Lenin eight months later.

And that government was essentially one dominated by moderate socialists.

It was a government that very quickly sort of turned to the left.

You know, the guy we associate with that is Alexander Kerensky.

Alexander Kerensky was a Russian socialist, a politician.

He was the quasi-dictator of that regime.

He''s the person, not the Tsar, who''s overthrown by Lenin.

So the revolutionaries and they did not proved to be the fatal threat to the Tsarist regime.

It was the Tsarist political system itself that did that.

What then transpired was that the Okrona and its method and many of its agents then immediately segwayed over into the new Soviet security surface.

So one of the first things that Lenin did in December of 1917, within a month of seizing power, Or, since the hold on power was tenuous at best, was that, well, you''re going to need some kind of organization to infiltrate and suppress those pesky counter-revolutionaries in foreign imperialists and all of the other enemies that we have.

And so the extraordinary commission to combat counter-revolution and sabotage that Chakka was formed.

You put a veteran Bolshevik Felix Zerszynski at the head of that, someone you could politically rely upon.

But Zerszynski built his organization essentially out of the Okron, I mean, they''re all of these informers sitting around with nothing to do.

And they were employed.

In the early 20s, the kind of rank and file of the Czech might have been 80-90% former imperial officials.

Those were gradually decreased over time.

So why would they do that?

Well, they were professionals.

They also needed to eat, and things were somewhat precarious.

So if your job is to be an agent provocateur or if your job is to infiltrate targeted organizations and lead them astray, you do that for whoever pays you.

That''s part of the professionalism which goes in.

And under But the Soviets, the Soviet intelligence services are also very good at that.

They are very good at infiltrating people into opposing organizations.

And I guess the one example I would give to demonstrate that of the Cambridge 5, the British traders, Soviet standpoint, he rose, who were recruited, known as the most notably Kim Filby, Guy Burgess, Donald McClan, Anthony Blunted.

and there may have been well more than five, but, you know, I wasn''t bad out of just Cambridge.

And then placing those people in high positions, the ultimate goal, of course, is to get your people into positions of leadership and influence in the opposing intelligence service.

And so they did.

Of course, it all fell apart and they ended up in, you know, Phil ended up living the last part of his life in exile in Moscow, but they got their money''s worth out of him.

And you can also find this in KGB Infiltration, the CIA, the FBI, the Aldrich Ames, Hansen cases.

Of course, we were infiltrating by we, I mean the Americas and the West, managed to infiltrate our moles as well.

But if it came down, someone could dispute this, but I think if you were going to come down to a kind of like a who had the most moles superbowl?

Probably the Soviets would come somewhat ahead of that.

So the scale of the infiltration, the number of people, and the scale of it.

Is there a case to be made that the Akrona and the Chakka orchestrated both the components of the Russian Revolution, as you described them.

Well, there''s an interesting question for me, I mean, there are all kinds of questions about this.

I mean, one of the questions is whether or not Lennon was an Okrona agent.

Okay, I''ve just said heresy.

Some people will, I''ll do that quite often because I am a heretic and proud of it.

Great.

Why would you possibly say that Lennon could have been an Okrona agent?

Well, let''s look what he managed to do.

So you had, coming into the 20th century, a single, nominally, a single Marxist movement, the Russian social democratic labor party.

And Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, majority and minority-ites are merely factions of that party and they always agreed that they were all Marxists and we all believe in dialectical materialism and the rise of so we''re all we''re all socialist comrades the difference was the the tactical means by which one would attain this and what Lenin wanted was a militant small-scale vanguard party wanted a revolution I wanted to seize power, seize control of the state, and once you have the state, then you induce socialism from above.

Whereas the majority of the people, the so-called Minishiviks, the minorityites who are oddly enough the vast majority of the party, that''s one of the first things.

How do you lose that argument?

How does the minority get to grab the name majority the ice, but Lenin did that.

So what Len wanted was a conspiratorial party of committed revolutionaries that would plot and scheme and undermine it eventually seized control of the state and induce socialism from above.

There were other Russian Marxists who thought that that sounded vaguely totalitarian and not really democratic and not even terribly socialist.

And they opposed that But ineffectively from the beginning, outmaneuvered every step of the way.

The Mensheviks are a case study in failure of a political organization.

That too will be heresy to some people, but look, they lost.

Now, so what Lenin managed to do, starting around 1903, continuing under this, is he managed to divide, to take what had been a single Marxist party and split it into angry, contending factions.

Because he and his Bolsheviks run one side, advocating a much more militant conspiratorial policy.

The discombobulated men''s shiviks were over in the other, and in between where a lot of people really didn''t know where they stood on this.

I mean, sometimes they kind of agree it seems to making sense today.

No, no, I don''t think he''s making sense in that day.

But he managed to completely disunify this organization.

Now, who could possibly have seen benefit in that?

The Ograna.

Now, whether or not they put him up to it, whether or not in some way they helped move him into a position of leadership or encouraged it or encouraged it through people around him, whether he was a witting or unwitting agent of the Zara''s secret police.

He certainly accomplished exactly what it was that they wanted.

And I find that suspicious.

It''s one of those things that it''s so convenient in a way is that I''m not necessarily sure that was an accident.

There''s also this whole question to me as to what was going on within the Ocronut itself.

Now this is one of these questions when I come to you later about how intelligence agencies interact or serve the governments to which they are theoretically subordinate.

it.

They do tend to acquire a great deal of influence and power.

After all, their main job is to collect information.

And that information could be about all kinds of things, including people within the government structure itself.

And they also know how to leverage that information in a way to get people to do what you want them to do.

So an argument can be made, again, an argument, not a fact merely an opinion, which is mostly what history is made out of, opinions, is that at some point, between about 1919 and 1917, people with the Okrona were playing their own game.

And that game took them in a direction which meant that continued loyalty to the Emperor, specifically to Nicholas II, was no longer part of that.

To me, in a way, it seems almost during the events of 1917 that, one, you had an organization that was very effective when it did this, suddenly it just becomes ineffective.

It doesn''t really disappear.

These things don''t go away because it will reappear, yes, it''s the Ochoca, basically fairly quickly.

But it raises the question to me, is the one degree there were people within the organization who allowed events to take the course they wished.

I always wonder how much deliberate planning there is within an organization like O''Connor, or if there''s kind of a distributed intelligence that happens.

Well, one of the key elements at any kind of intelligence organization or operation is compartmentalization.

Need to know.

So, rarely do you have an occasion where everybody, everybody in an executive position are all brought into a big corporate meeting and we discuss all of the secret operations that are going on.

No, you never do that.

Only a very limited number of people should know about that.

If you have a person who is a case officer who is controlling agents, he''s the only one who should know who those people are.

Possibly his immediate superiors, but no way do you want that to become a knowledge.

So information within the organization itself is compartmentalized.

So you don''t need everybody to be in on it.

You don''t even need necessarily the people who were nominally at the top.

For instance, the Ocrona, the real boss of the Ocrona, was the imperial ministry of the interior.

The minister of the interior, in fact, but the minister of the interior had no real effective control over this at all.

I mean, to the point was that at one point early on, they actually organized the assassination of their own boss.

They have their agents among the revolution, or is killed, the minister of the interior.

Because he''ll disappear, be replaced by another one, he is an imperial bureaucrat.

He''s not really part of their organization.

You know, it''s like a director of an intelligence agency appointed by the president.

Maybe he''s part of the organization.

Maybe he isn''t.

Maybe he is not one of us.

So you''ve got different levels, different compartments within it, and who''s actually running the show, if anyone is, I don''t know.

That''s never supposed to be apparent.

Well, that''s a fascinating question.

I mean, you can see this with NKVD.

It''s obviously an extremely powerful organization that starts to eat itself, where everybody''s pointing fingers internally also, as a way to gain more power.

So the question is, in organizations like that, that are so compartmentalized, where''s the power, where''s the center of power?

Because you would think given that much power, some individual or a group of individuals will start accumulating that power, but it seems like that''s not always a trivial thing.

Because if you get too powerful, the snake eats that person.

Well, we go back into the founder of Soviet secret police, Felix Czezinski.

Czezinski dies in 1926.

Heels over, after giving a heated speech to a party meeting.

Now, the common view, what you usually read, which was key for the time, was that clearly Stalin had him whacked, because anytime someone died, it was almost always it.

And I think a lot of times he did.

but in some cases, Stalin''s probably getting blamed for things that he didn''t actually do.

There''s Jinski wasn''t even opposed to Stalin, so it''s not clear why he would be, but this was that, you know, Stalin died, you know, obviously he was poisoned, something happened, it was an unnatural death, somebody goes in for an operation, you know, it gets a little too much anesthesia, Stalin killed them.

Somebody tips over in a canoe and upstate New York.

Stalin killed them.

There''s actually a case about that.

So that itself can be kind of useful where every time someone dies they think you kill them.

That''s a kind of an interesting method of intimidation in that regard.

But the suspicion he was seemingly firmly in control of the organization.

Of course, maybe he wasn''t.

Maybe he was, my guess would be, is that if Tuzinski''s death was not natural causes, that he was probably eliminated by someone within his own organization.

And then you look at the people who take over.

His immediate success area is, Vyacheslav Menzinski, who''s really not, a really a secret policeman, more kind of intellectual dilatant.

But if you look behind him, Jonas the fellow is Henrik Jagoda.

And Jagoda will really sort of manage things from behind the scenes until Menzinski dies in 1934.

And then Jagoda will hold on till he''s a victim of the purges, I think in 37 or 38.

Yagoda is ambitious, murderous, and if I was going to point the finger to anybody who possibly had Zerszynski whacked, it would be him, and for the purpose is simply of advancement.

That''s the person to look out at any kind of corporate organization is your immediate it, subordinate the person who could move into your job because more than likely that''s exactly what they''re planning to do.

Yeah, just one step away from the very top.

Somebody there will probably accumulate the most power.

You mentioned that the various Russian intelligence agencies were good at creating agent provocateurs infiltrating the halls of power.

What does it take to do that?

Well, there''s an interesting little acronym called MICE, M-I-C-E, and it''s, you know, generally used.

And it''s just the way in which you would acquire, how do you get people to work for you?

Well, M stands for money.

You pay them.

People are greedy.

They want money, you know, if you look at Aldrich Ames, he had a very, very expensive wife with expensive tastes.

So you want him money.

I is for ideology, so during particularly in the 1920s and the 1930s, the Soviets were very effective in exploiting communists, you know, people who wanted to serve the great cause.

Even though that''s initially not really what they wanted to do because the idea was that if you recruit agents from among, let''s say, American communists, you compromise the party because exactly what you''re going to say is that all communists are Soviet spies.

They''re all traders in some way.

So you would really want to keep those two things separate but ideology was just so convenient and those people would just work for you so well.

You could get them to do anything, betray their grandmother.

They would go ahead and do that for the greater good.

So ideology can be a motivation and that can be you know someone who is a who is a devoted Marxist-Leninist.

It can also be someone who''s a disgruntled communist because there''s no anti-communist like an ex-communist.

Those who lose the faith can become very, very useful.

For instance, if you look in the case of American intelligence, the people who essentially temporarily destroyed much of the KGB organization in the U.S. post-World War II, where people like Whitaker Chambers, Lewis Buttens, Elizabeth Bentley, all of those people have been Communist Party members.

They had all been part of the Red Faithful.

They all, for one reason or another, became disillusioned and turned rat, or pig-treat, Whichever case you may want to put in that regard, what is the C in the east hand for?

The C is for coercion.

That''s where you have to persuade someone to work for you.

You have to pressure them.

So usually you blackmail them.

You know, they could be they have a gambling habit, you know, in the old days, it''s very often because they were gay, okay?

Guess them an decision where they can be compromised and you can get them to do your bidding, that those people usually have a certain amount of control.

Here''s an interesting example of how the Ocron attempted to handle this.

I think it''s still largely used.

You''d round up a bunch of revolutionaries on some charge or another distributing revolutionary literature, running any illegal printing press.

You bring a guy into the room and you say, okay, they''re gonna work for us.

Of course, it refused to do so.

And they go, well, if you refuse, we''ll keep the rest of your comrades in jail for a while, you know, maybe beat them with a rubber truncheon or so.

And then we''re just going to let you go.

We''re just going to put you back out on the street.

And if you don''t work for us, we will spread the rumor through our agents already in your organization that you are.

And then what will your comrades do?

How long are you going to live?

So you see you have no choice, your hours, and you''re going to cooperate with us.

And the way that that effectiveness would be insured is that you have multiple agents within the same organization who don''t know who each other are.

That''s very important.

And they''ll all be filing reports.

So let''s say you have three agents inside the central committee of the SR party and there''s a committee meeting and you''re going to look at the reports that well they all better agree with each other, right?

If one person doesn''t report what the other two do then perhaps they''re not entirely doing their job and they can be liquidated at any time.

All you do is drop the dime on them.

and this was done periodically.

In fact, in some cases, you would betray your own agents just to completely discombobulate to the organization.

This happened in one particular case around 1908, the fellow who was the head of the chief revolutionary terrorist organization, which wasn''t Bolshevik, but the so-called socialist revolutionaries.

They''re actually the biggest revolutionary part of the SRs, who are even actually Marxists, more anarchists.

But they went all in for the propaganda of the deed.

They really like blowing people up and carrying out quite a campaign of terrorism.

The fellow who was the head of that terrorist organization, was a fellow of the name of You have no azef, and you have no azef, was guess what?

An Okrona agent.

Everything he did, every assassination that he planned, he did in consultation with his control.

So he''d kind of run out his string, there was increasing suspicion of him.

Me, I was also asking for a lot more money.

So the Okrona itself arranged to have him write it out.

and what did that do?

Well, what do you do in your party when you find out the chief of your terrorist brigade was a secret police agent?

It''s a consternation and mistrust.

Nobody in the party would ever trust in you couldn''t tell who you were sitting around.

I know that a fellow I wrote a biography on Boris Sevinkoff who was a Russian revolutionary and the second in command within the terrorist organization.

By the way, the guy that wanted Ozeth''s job so bad he could taste it.

Well, on the one level, he expressed absolute horror that his boss was a police agent, and will he should, because Seffinkoff was a police agent, too.

See, they already had the number two waiting in the wings to take over.

But he was legitimately shocked.

He didn''t really suspect that.

So it''s a way of manipulating this and then finally become to the E that I think is the most important ego.

Sometimes people spy or betray because of the egotistical satisfaction that they receive.

The sheer kind of Machiavellian joy in deceit.

An example of that would be Kim Filby, one of the Cambridge Five.

Now Filby was a communist, and he would argue that he always saw himself as serving the communist cause.

But he also made this statement, I think it''s in the the preface to his autobiography.

And he This says one never looks twice at the offer of service in elite force.

They saw him by his recruitment by the NKVD in the 1930s, and he was absolutely chuffed by that.

The mere fact that they would want him, what he considered to be a first-rate organization would want him, satisfied his ego.

And if I was to take a gasses to whether it was ideological motivation, whether it was the romance of communism, or there it was the appeal of ego that was the most important in his career or treason, I''d go with ego.

And I think that figures into a lot.

People don''t, someone doesn''t get the promotions that they wanted.

Again, if you look at something like Aldrich Ames career in particular, you''ve got these kind of...

His career in the CIA was hit or miss.

He didn''t get the postings or promotions that he wanted as a value-ish.

You never felt that he got credit for doing that.

And that''s the type of thing that tends to stick in someone''s crawl and can lead for egotistical reasons and adage incentive to betray.

Yeah, that there''s a boost to the ego when you can deceive.

Sort of not played by the rules of the world and just play with powerful people like they''re your pawns.

You''re the only one that knows this.

You''re the only one that knows that the person who is sitting across from you, to which you have sworn your loyalty, you''re simultaneously betraying.

What a rush that must be for some people.

I wonder how many people are susceptible to this.

I would like to believe that people have, a lot of people haven''t the integrity to at least withstand the MI, the money and the ideology, the pull of that, and the ego.

It can also be a combination of the two.

I mean, you can create a recipe of these things, certain amount of money, ego, and the little push of coercion.

But if you don''t, we''ll wrap you up.

You''ll be exposed.

What are some differences to you as we look at the history of the 20th century between the Russian intelligence and the American intelligence in the CIA?

If you look at both the Ochrana and the KGB, one of the things that you find consistent is that they a single organization handled foreign intelligence that is spying upon enemy or hostile governments and also internal security.

So that''s all part of it.

Whereas if you look at the U.S. models that evolve, you eventually have the FBI, who under Hoover, who insists that he''s going to be the counterintelligence force.

Okay, if they''re, you know, if there are commis spies are running around America as the FBI who''s supposed to fair at them out.

The CIA is not supposed to be involved in that.

And the charter, the basic agreement in 1947, did not give the CIA any.

It''s often said they were barred from spying on Americans, which isn''t quite true.

You can always find a way to do that.

What they don''t have is they don''t have any police or judicial powers.

They can''t run around in the country carrying guns to use on people, they can''t arrest you, they can''t interrogate you, they can''t jail you, they have no police or judicial powers.

Now that means they have to get that from someone else, that doesn''t mean that other agencies can''t be brought in or local police officials, corn or whatever you need, you can eventually acquire but they can''t do that directly.

So we''ve got this division between foreign intelligence and domestic counterintelligence, often split between hostile organizations, the relationship between the FBI and the CIA.

I think it''s fair to say it''s not shummy, never has been.

It''s always been a certain amount of rivalry and contention between the two.

And it''s not to say that something like that didn''t exist between the domestic counterintelligence and foreign intelligence components of the KGB, but there would be less of that to a degree because there was a single organization that were all answerable to the same people.

So that gives you a certain greater amount, I think, of leeway and power because you''re controlling both of those ins.

I remember somebody telling me once that and he was a retired KGB officer.

There you go, retired.

One of the things that he found amusing was that in his role, one of the things that he could be is that he could be anywhere at any time in any dress.

Which meant that he could be in or out of uniform and any place at any time.

He was authorized to do that.

So more freedom, more power.

I think one of the things that you would often hit the view is that well, the Russians are simply, you know, naturally meaner.

There''s less respect for human rights.

There''s a greater tendency to abuse power that one might have.

I mean, frankly, they''re all pretty good at that.

They''re probably, it is fair to say that there''s probably some degree of cultural differences that are not necessarily for institutional reasons, but cultural reasons, there could well be things that Americans might bulk it doing more than you would find on the Russian or Soviet side of the equations.

The other aspect of that is that Russian history is long and contentious and bloody.

One of the things that certainly teaches you never trust foreigners.

Every foreign government, anywhere, any country on your border is a real or potential enemy.

They will all, at some point, have given the chance, invade you.

Therefore, they must always be treated with great suspicion.

Oh, it goes back to something, and I think the British observed was that countries don''t have friends, they have interests, and those interests can change over time.

Well, the CIA is probably equally suspicious of all other nations, but you''re supposed to be suspicious.

Your job is not to be trusting.

Yeah, the basic job of an intelligence agency is to safeguard your secrets and steal the other guys and then hide those away.

Are there laws, either intelligence agencies, that they''re not willing to break?

Is it basically lawless operation to where you can break any laws long as it accomplishes the task?

Well, I think John LaCarré gave his pen name.

He was talking about his early recruitment into British intelligence.

And one of the things he remember being told up front, well, If you do this, you have to be willing to lie, and you have to be willing to kill.

Now, those are things that, in ordinary human interactions, are bad things.

Generally, we don''t like it when people lie to us.

We expect that people will act honestly towards us, whether that''s being a business man you''re involved with, your employers.

We''re often disappointed in that because people do lie all the time for a variety of reasons, but honesty is generally considered to be it, but in a realm where deception is a rule, dishonesty is a virtue to be good at that, to be able to lie convincingly is good.

It''s one of things you need to do.

And killing also is generally frowned upon.

You know, put people in prison for that.

There are otherwise executed, but in certain circumstances killing is one of those things that you need to be able to do.

So what he felt he was being told in that case is that, you know, once you enter this realm, the same sort of moral rules that apply in general British society do not apply.

And if you''re squeamish about it, you won''t fit in you have to be able to do those things.

I wonder how often those intelligence agencies in the 20th century and of course the natural question extending it to the 21st century how often they go to the assassination.

How often they go to the kill part of that versus just the espionage.

Let''s take an example from American intelligence, this from the CIA 1950s, 1960s, into the 1970s, M.K. Ultra.

' upon.

You know, put people in prison for that.

There are otherwise executed, but in certain circumstances killing is one of those things that you need to be able to do.

So what he felt he was being told in that case is that, you know, once you enter this realm, the same sort of moral rules that apply in general British society do not apply.

And if you''re squeamish about it, you won''t fit in you have to be able to do those things.

I wonder how often those intelligence agencies in the 20th century and of course the natural question extending it to the 21st century how often they go to the assassination.

How often they go to the kill part of that versus just the espionage.

Let''s take an example from American intelligence, this from the CIA 1950s, 1960s, into the 1970s, M.K. Ultra.

That is a secret program which was involved with what is generally categorized as mind control, which really means messing with people''s heads.

And what was the goal of that?

Well, was, I recently acquired, quite legally, by the way, it''s declassified, but it''s from 1949.

So this is only two years after the CIA came into existence.

And it''s an FBI memo because the FBI, of course, very curious what the CIA is up to.

And the FBI are not part of this meeting, but they have someone in, they''re sort of spying on what''s going going on.

So there was a meeting which was held in a private apartment in New York.

So it''s not held in any kind of, you know, it''s essentially never really happened because it''s in somebody''s house.

But there are a couple of guys there from the CIA.

One of them is Cleve Baxter.

Cleve Baxter is the great godfather of the lie detector.

Pretty much everything that we know or think we know about lie detectors today, you owe to Clee Baxter.

He''s also the same guy that thought that plants could feel, but somehow was a derivative of his work on lie detectors.

So these guys are there and they''re giving a talk to some military and other personnel and there are certain parts of the document which are of course redacted, but you could figure out what it is that they''re talking about and they''re talking about hypnotic suggestion and all the wonderful things that you can potentially do with hypnotic suggestion.

And two of the things they note is that one of the things we could potentially do is erase memories from people''s minds and implant false memories.

That would be really keen to do that, just imagine how that would be done.

So here to me is the interesting point.

They''re talking about this in 1949.

MK Although they''re all sorts of, you know, art and joke, and others, everything is sort of leading up to that.

It''s simply an elaboration of programs that are already there.

I don''t think that it ultimately matters whether you can implant memories or erase memories.

To me, the important part is the thought they could and they were going to try to do it.

And that eventually is what you find out in the efforts made during the 1950s and 60s through MK-Ultra, MK Surge, MK Naomi, and all the others that came out.

That''s one of the things they''re working for, and among the few MK-Ultra era documents that survived, there''s that whole question is that you get someone to put a gun to someone''s head and pull the trigger and then I remember it later, yeah, you could interestingly enough.

So non-direct violence, controlling people''s minds, controlling people''s minds at scale and experimenting with different kinds of ways of doing that.

One person put it that the basic argument there are the basic thing you''re after was to understand the architecture of the human mind, how it worked, how it put together, and then and how you could take those pieces apart and assemble them in different ways.

So this comes, this is where hypnosis comes in, which is a, was then still is, fairly spooky thing.

Nobody''s ever explained to me exactly what it is.

The idea was that could you, you think of the whole possibilities in this case, could you create an alternate personality?

And use that alternate personality in an agent role, but then be able to turn it on and off.

So, subsequently, the person, which that personality inhabited, was captured and interrogated, tortured, you know, and their fingernails torn out, they would have no memory of it.

They couldn''t give any kind of secret away because it was embedded in some part of their brain, where there is a completely different person.

I mean, you can just imagine the possibilities that you can dream up.

And again, it''s not, I think, the question is to whether you, that is possible or whether it was done.

Although I suspect that both of those are true, but that you would try to do it.

Then imagine the mischief that comes out of that.

And one of the big complaints from a legal standpoint about MK Ultra and the rest is that you were having medical experiments, essentially, being carried out on people without their knowledge and against their will, which is, you know, a no-no.

Yeah, the fact that you''re willing to do medical experiments says something about what you''re willing to do.

And I''m sure that same spirit, innovative spirit, persist to this day.

And maybe less so.

I hope less so in the United States, but probably in other intelligence agencies in the world.

Well, one thing that was learned in the reason why most MK Ultra and similar records were destroyed on order in the early 70s, around the time the CIA became under certain amount a scrutiny.

The mid-70s were not a good time for the agency because you had the church committee breathing down their neck.

People were asking lots of questions.

So you need to dump this stuff because you were committing crimes against American citizens.

So let''s eradicate it.

And the important lesson to be learned is that never do this type of thing again, where at least in any way in which the agency''s direct fingerprints are placed on it.

You can pay people, you can subsidize research, you can set up venture capital firms, you got plenty of money, and you can funnel that money into the hands of people who will carry out this research privately, so if something goes wrong, you have perfect deniability.

On the topic of mice, on the topic of money, ideology, coercion, and ego, let me ask you about a conspiracy theory.

So there is a conspiracy theory that the CIA is behind Jeffrey Epstein at a high level if you can just talk about that.

Is that something that''s at all even possible that you have?

Basically, this will be for coercion.

You get a bunch of powerful people to be sexually mischievous and then you collect evidence on them so that you can then have leverage on them.

Well, let''s look at what Epstein was doing.

He was a businessman who then also developed a very lucrative sideline and being a high-level procurer Basically in supplying young girls and He also Filmed much of that activity I Think his partner this Jelaine, and I''m hoping for an out sinker.

I think it''s good lane Gilein?

Well, I''ve heard it both ways.

Gilein or Gilein, whichever it may be.

I think her argument at one point was that, well, we did this to protect ourselves.

But this type of thing has been done before.

There''s nothing new about this.

Getting influential people and compromising situations and filming them.

I could give you another historical example of that in late 19 to an actually The early 1930s, just pre-Nazi Berlin, there was a very prominent sort of would-be psychic and occultist by the name of Eric Jan Hanneson.

He had a private yacht, I think it was called the Seven Sins, and he hosted parties.

He also had a whole club called the Palace of the Occult, which hosted parties where things went on, and there were cameras everywhere.

He filmed, important people.

You know, guys like the brown shirt chief of Berlin in various states of Undress and sexual Congress and he did that for the purposes of blackmail So in Epstein''s case he is a crocure of young girls to wealthy men largely and And many of those events were recorded.

Now, even if it wasn''t his intention to use them for blackmail, think of what someone else could do it because people know about this.

So, you could raise a question, is this not, you know, Epstein is just kind of a greedy pervert.

But through his greedy perversion, he''s now collecting information that could be useful.

Who could that be useful to?

Who would like dirt on Prince Andrew on the clue?

Think of all the people who were there, and there were important people who went to Lolita Island, so if it isn''t Epstein directly, I''m not trying to let him off the hook because to have anything for him.

He was either running his own blackmail business or someone was using him as a front for that.

I mean, I think we''re kidding ourselves.

We''re trying to pretend that''s not what was going on.

So you think you and American intelligence agencies would be willing to swoop in and take advantage of a situation like that?

Well, you know, just in case American politicians could ultimately end up in a position to oversee things like intelligence budgets.

One of them might even become director.

You never know, you can never tell what some crazy president might do.

It could be very, I look, one of the guys who understood the person was, was Jager Hoover.

Jager Hoover spent a long time collecting dossiers and politicians.

How do you think he''d remain director of the FBI as long as he did?

because he systematically collected dirt on people.

So there is a history of this type of thing and again you could argue that''s partly for his protection to keep his job to protect the sanctity and security of the Bureau.

You can find a There is that side to human nature.

Let''s put it that way.

Whether it''s the CIA or a crown, maybe that''s what the president of the United States sees when they show up to office is all the stuff they have on him or her and say that there''s internal mechanism of power that you don''t want to mess with and so you will listen.

Whether that internal mechanism of power is the military industrial complex or whatever, or the bureaucracy of government.

Conducted with the deep state.

The deep state.

Trinch to bureaucratic.

Well, it''s been said, and I think it''s generally true, that bureaucratic creatures, or like any other creatures, it basically exists to perpetuate itself and to grow.

I mean, nobody wants to go out of business.

And of course, you get all of these things like pizegate and accusations of one form or another.

But here''s an interesting thing to consider.

Okay, and I want to argue that I''m not saying that Pizzagate in any way was real or QAnon had to say that, but where do they get these ideas from?

So let''s ask ourselves, do pedophiles exist?

Yeah.

Do organized pedophile organizations exist?

Yeah, they share information, pictures, they''re out there on the dark web.

they cooperate.

So does trial trafficking exist?

Yeah, it does.

So in other words, whether or not specific conspiracy theories about this or that group of organized pedophile cultists is real, all the ingredients for that to be real are there.

Pedophiles exist, organized pedophilia exists, child and human trafficking exists.

At some point, at some time, someone will put all of those together.

In fact, certainly, they already have.

Well, jump around a little bit, but your work is so fascinating.

And it covers so many topics.

So let''s, if we jump into the present with the Bohemian Grove and the Bilderberg, older burgers, so the elites, as I think you''ve referred to them.

So this gathering of the elites, can you, can you just talk about them?

What is, what is this?

Well, first thing I have to point out is that Bohemian Grove is a place not an organization.

It''s where the Bohemian Club meets.

It''s that 2700 acre old growth redwoods, near, you know, north of San Francisco.

The Bohemian Club began the way back to the 1870s.

It''s initial members were mostly journalists.

In fact, supposedly the name itself comes from, it was a term for an itinerary journalist who moved paper to paper was called the Bohemian.

And although I think there may be other reasons why that particular term was chosen as well.

But I think the original five members, there were like three journalists, there was a merchant and there was a ventner guy owned a vineyard''s California house surprising.

None of them terribly wealthy, but they formed an exclusive men''s club, wasn''t still is.

Nothing terribly unusual about that at the time.

But it became fashionable.

And as it became fashionable, more wealthy people wanted to become part of it.

And the thing about getting rich guys to join your club is what rich guys have money.

And of course it''s one of those rich guys that bought Bohemian Grove where now you build your old boy''s summer cab, which is what it is.

They got cabins with goofy names.

They go there.

They perform skits.

They dress up in costumes.

Yeah.

True.

Some of those skits look like pagan human sacrifices, but you know, it''s just a skit.

What''s it really going on there?

So on the one hand, you can argue, look, it''s just, it''s a rich guys club.

They, you know, they like to get out here that the whole motto of the place is weaving spiders come not here.

So when we''re going to talk about business, We just want to get out into the woods, put on some robes, you know, burn a couple of effigies in front of the owl, have a good time, probably get drunk a lot.

What''s with the robes?

Why do they do weird creepy shit?

Why do they put on a mask and the robe and the, and do the plays and the, the owl with the, and the sacrificing, I don''t know, what I, why do you have a giant owl?

I mean, what exactly, why do you do that?

Well, what is that in human nature, because I don''t think rich people are different than not rich people.

What is it about wealth and power that brings that out of people?

Well, part of it is the ritual aspect of it.

And yeah, that clearly is a ritual.

The rituals are pretty simple.

The rituals are just a series of actions performed in a precise sequence to produce an effect.

That describes a lot of things.

It describes plays, symphonies, every movie you''ve ever seen.

A movie is a ritual.

It is a series of actions carried out in a precise sequence to produce an effect, but then it had its soundtrack to cue you to what emotions you''re supposed to be feeling.

It''s a great idea.

So the rich people should just go to a movie or maybe just go to a Taylor Swift concert.

Like, why, why do you have to put it?

Well, why the hell?

Part of it is to create this kind of sense, I suppose, of group solidarity.

You know, you''re, you''re all going to appear and also a way of sort of transcending yourself in a way.

You know, when you put on the robe, it''s like putting on a uniform.

You are in some way a different or more important person.

It''s a ritual.

Okay, the key ritual that became me and Grove is a thing called the cremation of care and cremation.

And that''s what it''s supposed to be.

It''s the, we''re going to put all of our, you know, we''re rich, important people we have to make all of these critical decisions life is so hard.

So we''re going to go out here in the woods, we''re going to kick back, and we''re all going to gather around the lake, and then we''re going to carry, it''s wicker, it''s not a real person.

And how would you know?

And then we''re going to, and this is the cremation of our care, but it''s a ritual which is meant to produce a sense of solidarity and relief among those people who were there.

The question comes down with the rituals is how seriously do you take them?

How important is this to the people who carry them out?

And the interesting answer to that is that for some people, it''s, you know, for some people, it''s just boring.

I mean, there are probably people standing around the owl who think this is ridiculous and can''t wait for it to get over with.

There are the people that are kind of excited about it to get caught up into it.

it, but other people can take it very seriously.

It''s all the matter of the intention that you have about what the ritual means.

And I don''t mean to suggest by that that there''s anything necessarily sinister about what''s going on, but it is clearly a ritual carried out for some kind of group reinforcing purpose.

And you''re absolutely right.

You don''t have to do it that way.

I''ve gone to summer camps and we never carried out mock sacrifices in front of an owl.

We did all those other things.

We didn''t even have any robes either.

So it goes beyond merely a rich guy''s summer camp, although that''s an aspect of it.

But it also I think often obscures that focusing on Bohemian Grove at the getaway of the club ignores that the club is around all the time.

That''s what''s at the center of this.

It is the club and its members.

So despite all the talk about no weaving spiders coming around here, what are the other features of the summer meeting are things called lakeside talks.

And this often people People are invited to go there, and one of the people who was invited, I think around 1968, was Richard Nixon, who was making his political comeback, and he was invited to give a talk, where very important people are listening.

And Nixon, in his memoirs, realized what was going on.

He was being auditioned just whether or not he was going to be right.

He recognized that that was really the beginning of his second presidential campaign.

he was being vetted.

So one of the main theories, call it a conspiracy theory and not about the Bohemian club and the gatherings, is that people of wealth and influence gather together.

And whether or not it''s part of the agenda or not, inevitably you''re going to talk about things of interest.

But to me, the matter of fact that you invite people in, political leaders to give lakeside talks means that there are weaving spiders, which are going on, and it is a perfect private venue to vet people for political office.

I mean, yeah, where else are you going to do it?

If you''re interested in vetting, if you''re interesting and powerful people selecting, well, see, here''s the question, are these guys actually picking who''s going to be president?

Is that the decision which is being made, or they''re just deciding what horses they''re going to back.

I think the latter is the simpler version of it, but it doesn''t mean this the other way around, but these are the kinds of, you know, I mean Nixon was, you know, there was the whole 1960 thing.

So he''s the new Nixon, remember this, and this is where the new Nixon apparently made a good impression on the right people, because he did indeed get the rebel conomination, and he did indeed become president.

Well, there could also be a much more innocent explanation of really, it''s powerful people getting together and having conversations and through that conversation influencing each other''s view of the world and just having a legitimate discussion of policies for policy.

Why wouldn''t they?

I mean, why would you assume that people are not going to do that?

It''s the owl thing with the robes.

Like, why the owl and why are the robes?

Which is why it becomes really compelling when guys like Alex Jones forgive me, but I''ve not watched his documentary.

I probably should at some point about the Bohemian Grove where he claims that there is Satanist, human sacrifice of, I think, children.

And I think that''s quite a popular conspiracy theory.

Or as lost popularity, it kind of like transformed itself into the QAnon set of conspiracy theories.

But I mean, can you speak to that conspiracy?

Let''s put it this way.

The general public rich people are inherently suspicious.

Yeah.

Great.

Let''s put it that way.

First of all, they''ve got all that money and exactly how did one obtain it.

And I do not have necessity adhered to the view that behind ever a great fortune there was a great crime, but there often are ways in which it''s acquired.

But I think it''s one of the things I think they can happen is particularly when people acquire huge amount of money.

And I won''t name any names, but let''s say there are people who perhaps in the tech sphere who, coming from no particular background of wealth, suddenly find themselves with $600 billion.

Well, what?

Well, this is the question you would have to ask yourself, why me?

Because you''re one of the rare, tiny group of human beings will ever have that kind of wealth in your hands.

Even if you are a convinced atheist, I think at some point, you have to begin to suspect that the cosmic muffin, providence, whatever it is, put this money in your hands to do what?

Achieve great thing, just think of all the stuff is.

So you''re going to start a foundation and you''re going to start backing all the things that you like.

This is, yeah, I think there''s an element of ego that comes in with it as well and Again, it may not be so much what the rich person with a huge amount of money at their disposal and a lot of Fuzzy ideas about what to do with it can be influenced by others It''s always that question is to who''s actually manipulating these events?

What''s going on in that regard?

I think in some way they can be a very useful sucker, you know, find somebody with a lot of money and get them to finance the things that you want them to do.

The Bohemian club is, I don''t think any of itself inherently evil or sinister, but it means that there are lots of different people who have different agendas.

It goes back to what I said about how somebody feels about the cremation of care ritual.

This is either just a waste of time, it''s just some sort of silly thing that we''re doing, or it is something of great importance, perhaps even mystical or religious importance, because that''s ostensibly what it''s pretending to be.

So what''s this question?

Is the the play becomes serious.

That tends to happen a lot.

You''ve studied a lot, a lot of cults and occultism.

What do you think is the power of that mystical experience?

Well, what is broadly referred to, well, what''s occultism?

What''s the occult?

The cult is the hidden.

That''s all it really means, specifically hidden from sight.

And the basis of it is the idea that what is hidden?

Well, what is hidden from us is most of the world, most of reality.

So the basic concept within occultism, the basic concept within most religions, which are approved forms of occultism, is that the world, the physical world that we are aware of is only a very small part of a much larger reality.

And that what the methods and practices of occultism, arguably do, is to allow someone to either enter into this larger reality or to access that larger reality for purposes to be exploited here.

The most interesting statement about, and a key element of this becomes the thing called magic.

Now, I don''t know magic, you know, it''s a guy standing on stage performing a trick.

But the interesting thing about a stage magician is that a stage magician is we know when we''re watching this that it''s a trick.

Yet we can''t really figure out if he does it well how that trick is being accomplished because it seems to defy physical laws and that''s what''s fascinating about it.

So even though you know it''s a trick, if you can''t figure it out, it has this kind of power of fascination.

But it''s mimicking something.

Stage magic is mimicking real magic.

So it''s real magic.

Well, let''s go back to Alistair Crowley because, you know, he always has to go.

I knew he was going to come up at some point in this.

really because he always does all roads lead to all roads lead to Alistair Crowley Alistair Crowley and I''ve said this enough so I should be able to get it right but I''m paraphrasing here it goes magic which of course he''s spelled with a K to you know or CK um is the the art and science of causing change to occur in conformity with will So in a way that''s sort of mind over matter, but it''s the idea that one can through will, through intention, bend reality, to make something happen, somebody wants to put it this way, it''s tipping the luck plane, so you know, you got some kind of a level plane, I''m just trying to do it just a little bit so the marble rules rolls over one side or another.

Now that presupposes a lot of things that is there a luck plane?

I don''t know but you know it''s it''s a good sort of idea to have but and here again don''t become overly bothered trying to figure out whether you actually can bend reality.

Become bothered by the fact that there are people who believe that they can and will go to great efforts to do so and will often believe they have succeeded.

So it''s this effort to make things occur in a particular way, maybe just to sort of nudge reality in one little way or another.

And that''s where things like rituals come in.

And rituals are a way of focusing, will and detention.

We''re all there.

We''re all thinking about the same thing.

And you have to imagine just how, you know, the pervasiveness of what could be called that that kind of magical thinking every day, is everywhere.

So let me give you an example.

You ever attended a high school football pep rally?

Think of what''s going on there.

Okay, your team is going to battle the other team.

You''ve now assembled everyone in the gymnasium.

You''ve got people who are dancing around in animal totem costumes.

And what are you chanting?

Everyone is supposed to chant that, you know, that the other team dies, okay, that you will be horribly defeated and that our team will be victorious.

That is a magic ritual.

The idea is, If it comes into this idea, it''s very practically about visualizing things, visualizing, manifesting, I love this term, where you need to manifest your success.

Well, that''s just magic.

That is trying to cause change in conformity with will.

So these things can happen without you being even consciously aware of what''s going on and you don''t need to be, because if you''re all a part of the of the mob, which is there in the gymnasium and you get into this and you get worked up and a cultist would argue what you''re doing is that you''re creating a huge amount of energy.

All these people are putting energy into something and that energy goes somewhere and maybe you can, maybe, just maybe, you actually can slightly increase the chances of your team''s victory.

Of course, your opponents are having their own ritual at the same time, so whoever has the bigger mojo will apparently win on the team.

So that''s a, I would say trivial example of that, but a clear one.

I do believe that there''s incredible power in groups of humans getting together and morphing reality.

I think that''s probably one of the things that made human civilization what it is.

Groups of people be able to believe a thing and bring that belief into reality.

Yes, that''s your exactly right.

Bring to conceive of something and then through intention will to manifest that into this realm.

And of course, that power of the collective mind can be leveraged by charismatic leaders to do all kinds of stuff.

Where you get cults that do horrible things or anything.

There might be a cult that has good things.

It depends.

We don''t call those cults.

Exactly.

Without endorsing this entirely and one of the questions, what''s the difference between a cult and a There''s always someone at the top who knows what''s going on generally who knows it''s a scam In a religion that person is dead.

So see I''ve just managed to insult every single really and and but that''s it It''s an interesting way of thinking about it because I think there is some degree of Accuracy in that statement.

You think actually the interesting psychological question is in in cults, do you think the person at the top always knows that it''s a scam?

Do you think there''s something about the human mind where you gradually begin to believe in you?

Begin to believe your own bullshit.

Yes, that seems to be that again as part of magic I think is believing your own bullshit.

It doesn''t necessarily mean that the head of the cult realized, but there''s someone, maybe the second, you know, always sort of looking in the lieutenant.

Someone probably has an idea about what''s going on.

The other thing it seems to be a kind of dead giveaway for what we call a cult is what''s called excessive reverence for the leader.

People just believe everything these people say.

I give you an example of the first time I ever encountered anything like that.

It was in Santa Barbara, California in the 1970s.

I was going to grad school and there was a particular cult locally.

I think it was Brotherhood of the Sun.

There was a same guy who was among the other things, followers were convinced to hand over all their money and personal belongings to him.

I believe he used part of that money to buy a yacht with.

Anyway, a lot of it went to him.

And then of course, working for free upon different cult-owned business enterprises of which there was several.

And there was a person I knew who became a devoted follower of this.

And it was all I could think of at one point was ask them what What the hell is the matter with you?

I mean, have you lost your mind?

What is it that this person can possibly be providing that you essentially are going to become slave to them, which is what they were doing?

And I actually give that credit in a way of sort of sparking my whole interest in things like secret societies.

And here again, as a disclaimer, I am not now, nor have I ever been the member of any eternal organization, secret society or cult that I know of.

And that''s what interests me about them.

Because I''m just always trying to figure out why people do these things.

See, like I said, why are the robes in the owl?

Why?

Why do you do that?

And it''s trying to figure it out.

I mean, I couldn''t even hack the boy scouts.

Okay, that was too much because to me you join an organization and the first thing it comes along is there''s somebody, there are rules and someone is telling you what to do.

Okay, I don''t like people telling me what to do.

I spent much my life trying to avoid that as much as possible and join a cult, there''s going to be someone telling you what to do.

Join the Bohemian Club and there''s going to be someone telling you what to do.

Obviously, a lot of people really get something out of that.

It becomes in some ways it''s sort of necessary for them to function.

But I do not understand it and my study of it is a personal error to try to understand why people do that.

And there are so many reasons, primary of which I would say is the desire and the human heart to belong.

Yes.

And the dark forms that it takes throughout human history, recent human histories, something I''d love to talk to you a bit about.

If we couldn''t go back to the beginning of the 20th century on the German side, you''ve described how secret societies like the Tule Society lay the foundation for Nazi ideology.

Can you, through that lens, from that perspective describe the rise of the Nazi party.

Well, I guess we could start with what on earth is the Tule Society?

So the Tule Society was a small German occult society.

That is they studied metaphysics, Are they a fancy word for occultism?

That appeared in Munich around 1917, 1918.

The key figure behind it was a German esotericist by the name of Rudolf von Zabotendorf.

Not his real name.

His real name was Adam Rudolf Glower.

He was adopted by a German nobleman, and got the name Phunzebotendorf.

And I like to say that name.

So I had this real thing about vague mysterious characters to show up and do things.

And trying to figure out who these people are.

So we''re working up in the years prior to the First World War.

So the tech editor is probably World War I.

He spends a lot of time in the Ottoman Empire.

Turkey.

It wasn''t on the Ottoman Empire, which was a fairly tumultuous place because in 1908 and 1909 there was a the Young Turk revolution.

You had a military coup which effectively overthrew the Ottoman Sultan and installed a military junta which would go on during the First World War to make its greatest achievement in the Armenian genocide, eventually created a genocidal military regime, which would lead the country into disastrous First World War, which would destroy the Ottoman Empire, out of which modern Turkey emerges, yada yada yada.

And by the way, we should take a tiny tangent here, which is that you refer to the intelligence agencies as being exceptionally successful.

And here in the case of the young Turks being being also very successful or in doing the genocide, meaning they''ve achieved the greatest impact, even though the impact on the scale of good to evil tends towards evil.

It''s one of those things that often comes out of revolutionary situations.

Revolution is always, always seek to make things better, don''t they?

We''re going to take a bad old regime, you know, the the sultan is, you know, and the sultan was bad.

I think it''s fairly sad.

Abdul Hamid II was not a, wasn''t called a red sultan because of his favorite color type, you think.

And the idea is that they were going to improve.

They were now going to, you know, the Ottoman Empire was a multinational empire.

They''re going to try to equalize and bring in the different groups, and none of that happened.

It became worse, okay, in the same way that you could argue that the goal of Russian revolutionaries was to get rid of the bad, old, incompetent Medieval Tsarist regime and to bring in a new, great, shining future, and it became even more authoritarian.

And the crimes of the imperial Russian regime pale the significance of what would follow in the same way that the crimes of Obdolomeid pale to when you get to the young Turks.

But that wasn''t necessarily the intention.

But on the bottom door for the German business man who''s who''s working in this period and at the whole point here is that the Ottoman Empire in this period is is a hotbed of political intrigue.

You know, all kinds of interesting things about it.

The Young Turk Revolution is essentially a military coup, but it is plotted in Masonic lodges.

Okay, I know technically Masonic lodges are never supposed to be involved in politics, but they are, or you know, the large meeting breaks up and then you plot the revolution.

So saying group of people, but it''s not technically the, but yes, and there''s the Macedonia resource a lodge in Tessaloniki was ground zero for plotting this military coup that was supposed to improve the Empire.

Zabotendorf is in one way or another mixed up in all of this, or at least he''s an observer, plus he''s initiated, he''s initiated into the Masonic lodges.

And interestingly enough, the fellow who initiates him into one of these Eastern lodges is a Jewish merchant by the name of Termoody and who''s also a cabalist and in false out so what in the north is very very interested in the occult he''s initiated into Eastern Masonic lodges and appeared when those same lodges are being used as a center for political intrigue.

He also apparently is involved in gun running, which in revolutionary periods is, you know, there''s a lot of money to be made off of that.

So he''s connected to various dark businesses in a tumultuous time with connections to politicized Freemasonry and the occult.

Now, in the course of the First World War, he returns to Germany.

He just shows up.

And it would be my operative suspicion or theory that Zobotendorf was working for someone.

I don''t think he just pops up in Munich on his own accord.

Why does he leave the Ottoman Empire and return to their place?

Who''s behind him?

Well, maybe no one, but maybe someone, because he doesn''t seem to have money at his disposal, and he comes into Munich and he basically takes over this small sort of occult study group.

Now, Now, the interesting thing is that the Tule Society is really just a branch of another existing, what''s called, an aereosophist order, a thing called the German Order or the Germanen Order, which is centered in Berlin.

But for some reason, he doesn''t want his group to be connected by name with the Germanen So, Tuley society, Tuley in this case is a reference to supposedly a mythical, Arctic homeland of the Aryan race.

Apparently, there are all snow people who wander out of the snow at some point.

It''s kind of like a frozen Atlantis.

So, I mentioned these people, the Aureosophists, who, which is, you have to practice saying that.

So, what are they?

Well, they''re a kind of racist, Germanic offshoot of theosophy.

And I know I''m explaining one thing to explain something up, but there''s no other way to do this.

So theosophy was 19th century, very popular and widely modeled, a cult belief that was found by a Russian woman with the name of Helena Blavatsky.

She was a medium psychic, she''s supposed to get channelings from the Ascended Masters.

' his group to be connected by name with the Germanen So, Tuley society, Tuley in this case is a reference to supposedly a mythical, Arctic homeland of the Aryan race.

Apparently, there are all snow people who wander out of the snow at some point.

It''s kind of like a frozen Atlantis.

So, I mentioned these people, the Aureosophists, who, which is, you have to practice saying that.

So, what are they?

Well, they''re a kind of racist, Germanic offshoot of theosophy.

And I know I''m explaining one thing to explain something up, but there''s no other way to do this.

So theosophy was 19th century, very popular and widely modeled, a cult belief that was found by a Russian woman with the name of Helena Blavatsky.

She was a medium psychic, she''s supposed to get channelings from the Ascended Masters.

The basic story there, they''re all of the Ascended Masters, which are mystical beings that may or may not have once been human.

They live inside the Himalayas, or they float among them on a cloud, and they guide the spiritual evolution of humanity.

But Blavansky did was to take Western esotericism and blend it with Hindu and Buddhist esotericism, which became very, very sexy in the West.

Still is.

You know, Buddhism attracts a lot of people because, well, it''s Buddhism.

It''s different, see?

So, you know, the Mahatmas, the Ascended Masters were sent to hear messages.

It''s by the fact that she was later proven pretty much to be a fraud running the letters herself.

Nevertheless, people still went along with this doctrine and it''s been widely modified and copied since then.

So an idea in Theosophyte was that human spiritual evolution was tied to physical evolution.

So in the case of Wolfoski, Lavoski never said that Aryans white people anything out this per superior.

She talked about, you know, the different root races, but it''s just, or a version of it, it''s just total gobbledygoup that seems to include everyone it.

I did defy you to make much sense out of it.

But in the early 20th century, there are different sort of, you know, one of the things that became fashionable, you know, not terribly popular.

These are small movements with the idea idea that, well, Germany is a new upcoming country.

And part of this, I think, was really trying to define who the Germans were because, remember, the German Empire, Germany, as a political state, doesn''t come into existence till 1871.

Prior to that, Germany was a geographic graphic expression, a vague one, which described a large area in central Europe, where a lot of people who wore leather shorts, or something like that, and spoke similar German dialects were nominally Germans, but they might be Prussians or Bavarians, or they came in all sorts of varieties and really so there was no German identity.

something very similar happened in Italy in the same period.

I mean, there were Italians, there were Sardinians, there were Romans, and there were Sicilians, Umbrians, spoke again dialects of a similar language, but it never lived, you know, not since the Roman Empire under a single state and really didn''t think of themselves as the same.

So you have to create this artificial thing.

You all going to be Germans.

Well, exactly what is that?

Much of it is an artificial creation.

You know, you have to decide upon some sort of standard dialect.

Okay, we''ll decide what that is.

You know, often dialect it only a few people actually speak and then they will be drilled into children''s heads through state schooling programs.

So I think this is the kind of milieu that it comes out of.

People who were trying to figure out what on earth Germans actually were and the need for some sort of common identity and you know that leads to everything like Wagnerian opera.

Richard Wagner wanted to create a German mythical music so he went back and stripped mind old German myths and cobbled them together into a lot of people standing on stage singing and that was his purpose.

He was a nationalist.

He was in many ways a kind of racialist nationalist.

This was his idea of trying to create out of bits and pieces of the past a new fangled form of German identity.

On the more mystical end of this, you had the idea that Germany must have been created for some special purpose because the Germans must be very special people.

We must have some particular destiny.

Then out of this, the direction this is heading.

Well, we''re all part of some sort of master race with some sort of ties to some sort of great civilization in the past.

Call it Tully, call it whatever you want to be.

They basically just invent things and try to attach those to the past.

And so Aereosophy was the arianized version of theosophy.

And what this did was to take the idea that That spiritual and physical evolution had led to the most advanced form of human beings, which were the Aryans, and the most advanced group of them were, of course, the Germans.

And this attracted appeal—like, keep in mind, again, this was not a mass movement.

This is very much a fringe movement.

Most people weren''t aware of it and weren''t particularly interested in it, but it had an appeal for those who already had a kind of esoteric bent in some form or another.

And this is where things like the Garman and Orden, the German order and their other groups.

It was only one of many sort of grew out of.

And what it was that the Tule Society as a branch, the Tule Gazelle shaft, was supposed to do was to study this.

It was an esoteric study group.

And so people would get together and they''d talk about things, probably make more stuff up and all sort of work around this idea of German areas is the most advanced type of human beings and all the wonderful things that the future would hold.

And the fact that this was in the midst of a war in which Germany was again fighting, they saw it for its existence, heightened those kinds of tensions as well.

So my suspicion, again, is that Zabotendorf in terms of who was behind him, that he was essentially called back to Germany to work either for the Prussian political police or for some aspect of German intelligence and security to try to mobilize a cultism or esotericism for the war effort.

Again, this is 1918, the war has gone on way too long, but then a few months Germany will collapse and it will collapse simply from the psychological exhaustion of the population.

So, this is almost like to help the war effort with a kind of propaganda, a narrative that can strengthen the will of the German people.

But what''s strengthen the will of some people?

You have to try to appeal to different aspects of this.

But the mystical aspect is one of those things that can be.

You can have a very powerful influence.

And the idea is that if we can come up with some kind of mystical nationalism, maybe that''s one to put it, a kind of mystical nationalism that can be exploited for the workers at this point, you''re kind of grasping at straws.

And this is a whole period when the Germans are marshalling the last of their forces to launch a series of offensives on the western front, the peace offensive, which will initially be successful, but will ultimately fail and lead to a collapse in morale.

But among the leadership of Germany, it was a recognition.

It was that national morale was flagging.

And one of the other things that was kind of raising its head was what had happened nearby a year, well, the Russian Revolution, which had now brought the idea, which brought another solution to all of this.

The idea of revolutionary Marxism.

Here we need to remind ourselves as to where Marxism comes from, not Russia, Germany.

Where was the largest Marxist party in Germany?

And Marx probably expected the revolution to begin in Germany.

Where else?

I mean, the Soviet Union is not very industrialized, Germany is, and so that''s why it would probably Russia at 5% of the population is a industrial workers in Germany.

40% of the population isn''t that.

So if any place was like made for Marxism, it was Germany.

I think that''s why it caught on at East Germany so well because it did kind of come home.

And it was a local belief.

It wasn''t something imparted, imported by the Russians.

It was a German invention.

So, the Tuley Society, one of the things you can see in this is the Tuley Society was particularly involved in sort of anti-Marxist or anti-Bolshevik agitation.

They saw themselves, the Bolton source saw them as this whole mood.

It was a counter to this.

It was a kind of counter-Marxist movement.

Can we sort of try to break that apart in a nuanced way?

So it was a nationalist movement.

The occult was part of the picture.

It occult racial theories.

So there''s a racial component like the Aryan race.

So it''s not just the nation of Germany.

And you take that and contrast it with Marxism.

Do they also formulate that in racial terms?

do they formulate that in national versus global terms like how do they see this Marxism formula is everything by class.

People are categorized by class.

You''re the part of the proletariat or part of the bourgeoisie or just you know you''re the part of the proletariat or just some sort of scum really needs to be swept into the dustbin of history.

Only workers count.

And that was what would take someone who was a nationalist would sort of drive them crazy because their ideas were trying to create a German people.

You know, we''re trying to create a common German identity.

But what the Marxists are doing is they''re providing Germans against each other by class.

German workers hate the German bourgeoisie.

German proletariat is supposed to German capitalists.

We''re all trying to fight this war together.

So that was why Marxism, particularly in the form of Bolsheism, was seen as unpatriotic.

And of course, it was opposed to the war as a whole.

The idea that parody Lenin was that the war was an imperialist war.

And the only thing that was good that was going to come out of it is that the imperialist war through all of the crises it was creating would eventually lead to a class war.

And that would be good because that would reconcile all of these things.

But think of the two very different versions of this, the Bolshevist version, or the Marxist version of Germany, it was going to be a class society in which we''re going to have to have some kind of civil upheaval which will have Germans fighting Germans.

Whereas the kind of mystical nationalism, the almost kind of religious nationalism that Zabotendor from the Tuli society had hitched its wagon to, held that Germans are all part of a single racial family, and that''s what must be the most important thing.

And that these can be different ways of trying to influence people.

It comes down to a matter of political influence.

So in a sense, I think that what Zabotendorff in the Tuley Society was trying to do, at least within Munich, was to use this idea of mystical nationalism as a potential rallying point for some part of the population to oppose these other forces, to keep people fighting.

The war is lost, though, by the, in November, you know, the Kaiser abdicates, and essentially the Socialists do take over in Germany.

That''s, things come very, very close to following the Russian model.

And you even get the Russian version or take on the Bolsheviks, which are the spartisists who try and fail to seize power early on.

But you do essentially end up with the socialist Germany.

And that then leaves, in the aftermath of the war, the Tule Society is sort of the odd man out, although they''re still very closely connected to the army.

Now, here''s one of the things that I find interesting.

When you get into 1919, who is that''s paying the boat and doors the bills, it''s the army.

The one thing the German army is absolutely determined to do is to preserve its social position and power, and they''re perfectly willing to dump the Kaiser to do that.

As sort of this deal, which is made, in November of 1918, Kaiser''s abdication, the proclamation of a German republic, which, you know, you just had this guy declare it.

It wasn''t really planned.

There''s the the Abert Groner Pact.

Groner is the chief of staff, general staff at this point.

Friedrich Abert is the chief socialist politician basically, and they make an agreement.

And the agreement basically is that the army will support Abert''s government if Abert supports the army.

And particularly that means the continuation of the officer corps and the general staff in one form or another.

So a deal is made and that of course is what will eventually help defeat the Spartansist uprising.

Now was the army doing some of the kinds of things that we''ve talked about with the intelligence agencies, this kind of same kind of trying to control the direction of the power.

Well, the German intelligence landscape in the First World War is obscure in many ways.

There are lots of things that are going on.

The German has a military intelligence service called Obtailung or Section 3B.

That''s just plain military intelligence.

You know, they''re constantly trying to collect military information, you know, before the war, about the weaponry and plans of the enemies, and then about what the operational plans were during the war.

It doesn''t really go much beyond that, though.

The German foreign office runs a kind of political intelligence service.

And that''s the one which is much more involved in things like subsidizing subversion in Russia, which is one of the things that the Germans sign on to fairly early.

Little diversion here in 1915, there is a Russian revolutionary who''s lived much of his life in Germany, who goes by the code name of Parvus.

And he essentially comes to the Germans in Constantinople, interesting enough, in Turkey.

He''s hanging around there the same time as the Bolton Dwarf is there, which I find curious.

So Parvus, or Alexander Helpand, to give his actual name, comes in and goes, look, there''s a lot of revolutionaries in Russia and there''s a lot of mistrust with the regime.

We think that the war will increase the contradictions in Russia''s society.

And, if you give me a lot of marks, I can finance this revolutionary activity.

And through subversion, I can take Russia out of the war.

Well, the Germans are facing a two front war.

That sounds great.

We''ll use money in order to, but notice what they''re doing.

The German general staff, a very conservative organization, not a bunch of revolutionaries, are going to finance revolution in an opposing country.

They are going to finance revolutionary subversion to take Russia out of the war, which basically works.

So that gives you another idea as to what the German military is willing to do.

They''re not revolutionaries, but they''ll pay revolutionaries to subvert another regime.

Now you''ve got the problem is that the revolutionary regime that your money helped bring to power is now threatening to extend into your country.

So the whole question for the army and for others in Germany in 1919 is how to keep Germany from going Bolshevik, from an asense being hoist by your own batard.

So the Tuley Society, I don''t think is a huge part of this program, but it is a part of it.

And it''s all an effort to try to keep control.

And that''s why the army is financing them.

That''s even where the army at some point then supplies them with its own propagandists.

So the Tuley Society begins to create under Subbotendor''s leadership what he called the rings of Tully.

And these are satellite organizations that aren''t the society as though, but they''re kind of controlled and inspired by it.

And one of those is the thing called German Workers'' Party.

And the German Workers'' Party again is local, it''s not large, it''s not terribly influential, but what does it aspire to be?

It aspires to be a party that will bring German workers away from the seductive influence of the Bolsheviks and into a more patriotic position, a patriotic.

And the way that I describe this is that it''s not an anti-communist organization.

It''s a counter-communist organization.

So you don''t create something which completely opposes it, you create something which mimics it, which is ultimately what the German Workers'' Party will become, is the National Socialist German Workers'' Party, known as that term, Socialist.

And that is, in my view, what Naziism is from the beginning.

It is a counter-communist movement.

But, and by the way, for people who don''t know, the National Socialist German Workers Party is also known as the Nazi Party.

So how did this evolution happen from those that complicated little interplay?

We should also say that a guy named Adolf Hitler is in the army at this time.

Yes.

Well, he''s going to come into this because remember, the army was going to supply its own propagandists develop the German workers party in the Tully Society do their work and the propagandists they supply them with is a man who the army trains sends to classes to learn the art of public speaking and propaganda and that fellow is corporal Adolf Hitler.

So how does Adolf Hitler connect with the German workers party?

Well, he''d been in the army during the war, the only regular job that he''d ever had.

Kind of liked it.

So, you often get the view that, well, at the end of the war, he joined millions of other German soldiers who didn''t have...

No, no, he stays in the army.

He stays in the army until 1921.

He''s on the army payroll, at the very time in which he is able to help them to set this up.

What appears to have happened is this, Sibotendorf had organized the Tully Society.

that didn''t had, you know, that had had tried to oppose, there''s actually a brief period of time in which the communists actually take over Munich, the Varian Soviet Republic, which doesn''t last very long, and eventually the army and volunteers put this down.

Well, that''s going on, by the way, Hitler is actually setting in the barracks in Munich wearing a red arm band because he is technically part of the soldiers who have got over to the Bavarian Soviet Republic.

He seems to have had flexible interests in this case.

So once order is restored, so to speak, the army comes in and decide that, well, one of the things we need, we need to have people who can lecture soldiers on patriotic topics.

And so there is a particular captain by the name of Karl Meier, who sort of spots Hitler.

He later describes him as like a stray dog looking for a master.

Hitler has a knack for public speaking.

Other soldiers will listen to him.

Yeah, some people can do that.

Some people can''t.

Meier decides that he''s a good candidate for further training.

So yes, they bring him in.

They turn him into a what''s called the Vémon, kind of liaison man.

And he''s an army propagandist.

And then you''ve got this little outfit called the German Workers'' Party.

And essentially what happens is that Hitler is sent in to take over leadership of that, which is what happens.

He shows up.

He attends the meeting.

There are like 50 people there.

By the way, the topic of the first meeting he''s at is how and why capitalism should be abolished, which is not what you might well expect.

And because remember, the German Workers'' Party is trying to cast itself as a counter Bolshevism.

So it''s not saying that capitalism is great, which is important.

Now, capitalism is evil.

We agree upon that.

We just agree it has to be destroyed from a nationalist point of view, as opposed from some sort of strange internationalist point of view.

So Hitler is essentially, as I see it, sent in by the army as their trained man to assume leadership within this small party and to use it for the army''s patriotic propaganda campaign.

And it''s a season doing so, even to the name change, to the national socialist or German workers party.

I mean, really what sounds more red than that?

So the interesting thing here is, from where did anti-Semitism seep into this whole thing?

It seems like the way they tried to formulate counter-Marxism is by saying the problem with capitalism and the problem with Marxism is that it''s really Judeo-capitalism and, quote, Judeo-Bolshevism.

From where did that ideology see been?

Well, that''s a huge topic.

Where does anti-Semitism come from?

Well, let''s start with that term itself, a term which I really grew increasingly to dislike, because it doesn''t actually say what it means.

means.

Anti-Semitism is anti-Jewism.

That''s all it is.

I''m not sure whether there is ever existed a person who hated Jews, Arabs, and Maltese equally.

That''s kind of hard to imagine.

I don''t know, but that''s technically what that would mean, because let''s face it, most semites are Arabs.

So if you''re an anti-Semite, then you don''t seem to distinguish choose from Arabs.

It makes no sense.

The origin of the term is invented by guess what?

An anti-Semite.

A guy in the 1870s, a German journalist by the name of Wilhelm Mar, who is, wouldn''t you know it, part Jewish himself, and who decides that you really need a better term than Uden Haas, Jew hate, which was the term because that just sounds so, you know, in elegant, doesn''t it?

Okay.

What do you want to call yourself a Jew-hater or an anti-Semite?

See, anti-Semitism, it''s got that ism part of the end of it, which means it''s a system of belief.

Anything that has an ism must somehow be scientific and important.

So, a part of the 19th century obsession with bringing, trying to bring science into something on one of the others.

So we''re going to get rid of Jew hate and we''re going to turn it into anti-Semitism.

And we''re only going to be talking about Jews, but we''ll never actually say that.

And somehow the invention of a Jew-hater to disguise the fact that he''s a Jew-hater, even though he''s partly Jewish, by inventing the term anti-Semitism, worked because everybody has bought it repeated did it ever since.

So, you know, I don''t know.

Maybe just because anti-Jewism would just be, is it too direct in some way?

Is it what we have difficulty confronting actually what is we''re talking about?

I do wish terms were a little bit more direct and self-explanatory, yeah.

Jew hate is a better term.

Well, the question thing comes, what exactly do you hate about Jews?

and a lot of this has to do with.

If you go back part of the 19th century, if Jews were hated, they were hated for religious reasons.

In Christian Europe, they''re hated because they weren''t Christians.

And they existed as the only kind of significant religious minority, but other than that, they tended to live separately.

They had little economic influence.

But Jews tend to live in stettles in the east, ghettos, elsewhere, and some were involved in banking and business, but they sort of remained segregated from much of society.

That changes when you get to the 19th century, and with what''s called Jewish emancipation.

And that means that between about 1,850 most European countries drop the various legal or social restrictions against Jews.

They are assimilated into the general society.

So ideally you stop being a German Jew and you become a Jewish German.

Those are two very different important concepts.

And what that does of course is that it opens up the professions, business world elsewhere.

were.

So Jews move who had been largely within those realms to begin with, they already had a good deal of experiencing and experiencing in banking business.

And they move into those areas and professions and become quite visible.

And that''s what then creates anti-Semitism.

Because in some way that is seen as part of the changes that have taken place, and there are a lot of things going on here, part of it has to do with the kind of wrenching social and economic changes that took place with industrialization.

So one of the things to keep in mind is that in the process of industrialization, just like today, whole classes of people were made extinct economically, craftsmen, for instance.

So, when factories came along and began to produce things with machines, all the crafts people who had made those things previously are now unemployed or go to work as wage labor in factories.

centuries.

So there are winners and losers in industrialization.

And what people saw in Germany and elsewhere is that among this new sort of rising capitalist elite, among these new professions, among the bureaucrats that are coming out of these burgeoning states, they were visibly a fair number of Jews.

So in some way, the rise of Jews in the minds of many people were connected to all of the other bad things that were going on.

Now the world was changing in a way we don''t like.

And seemingly the Jews are prospering while I am not.

And that was during Germany and elsewhere Jews became highly visible in the professions.

They became very visible in banking, they became visible in legal profession, they became visible in the medical profession.

And those are people that a lot of people would come in contact with, bankers, lawyers, and doctors.

They were not the majority of there, but vastly over-represented in terms of the general population, and especially within the cities.

So in that sense, the roots of anti-Semitism is that Jews in Germany and elsewhere, and not just in Germany by enemies, France, Britain, everywhere else, became identified with the bad changes that were that were taking place.

And but you also found that Jews were not only prominent among capitalists, they were also prominent among in the socialist movement as well.

So one of the things you could look around, we returned to Germany in 1919 in the aftermath of World War I, and you look around in Bavaria or elsewhere, you tend to find that there are a lot of Jews in visible positions on the German left.

Rose Luxembourg is but one example of that.

You know, Oigen Levine, some of them came in from Russia.

You know, when the Soviets send a representative to Germany in this period, it''s Karl Radek, a Jew.

so it wasn''t difficult to exploit that to argue that just as the ranks of capitalism was full of Jews, the ranks of Bolshevism or of the revolutionary left were full of Jews because you could easily go around and distinguish a great many of them.

They don''t have to be the majority, they just have to be numerous prominent invisible, which they were.

So this provided you a, in case of the propaganda of the German army, the type of stuff that Hitler was spewed out, they could put all the anti-capitalist rhetoric in there wanted to.

The army was never going to overthrow capitalism, and the capitalists knew they weren''t going to do it.

So go ahead.

Talk shit about us.

We don''t really care.

That''s not going to, because we know that the army would prevent that from happening.

The way to then undermine the real enemy, it was a scene, the the revolutionary left was to point out the the Jewish influence there.

I mean, look at Russia.

Well, Lenin is up at Trotsky.

There he is.

Look, there''s a Jew.

There''s one.

Rodik is a Jew.

It wasn''t hard to find him in that regard.

You gave a lecture on the protocols of the Elders of Zion.

It''s why they consider to be the most influential work of anti-Semitism ever, perhaps.

Can you describe this text?

Well, the protocols of the learned elders of Zion is probably one of the most troublesome and destructive works of literature that has ever emerged.

And yet its origins remain obscure, so you get a whole variety of stories about where it came from.

So the one story that is often used that it was the work of the Okrona, the Russian secret police, and in particular, it was all crafted in 1904 and 1905 in Paris.

There''s a whole description of Piotr Rajkovsky, who was the, supposed to be the chief of the Okron at the time, was the man behind it, and other fellow by the name of Matveg Olavinsky was the drafter of it, And that they had this document written by a French political writer from some decades back called Dialog and Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, which they were then adapting, usually it''s argued that they plagiarized it into the protocols.

And none of that is really true.

I mean the first part about it is that at the time this supposedly took place Raj Kufsi wasn''t working for the Okrona.

He''d been fired and he wasn''t in Paris and the whole situation which is described couldn''t have taken place because the people who did it weren''t there.

It''s a story.

But it provides a kind of explanation for it.

So the protocols emerge.

So they always have to go back.

This is one of the things that I have found always useful in research is go back to the beginning.

Find the first place this is mentioned or the first version or the first iteration.

Where does it start?

So you go back to St. Petersburg, Russia, run 1903.

There is a small, right-wing anti-Semitic newspaper, published there called Znamya, banner.

And it publishes in a kind of serial form a work that doesn''t credit with any original author.

And this is the first version of the protocols of the learned elders of Zion.

But what it''s actually describing is a Judeo-Musonic plot to rule the world.

Those two terms are always combined together.

And I think in the earlier version, there''s far more mentions of Freemasons than there are Jews.

views.

And it''s, you know, the publisher of Namya, it''s closely connected to a thing called the Union of Russian people, the Union of Russian men, which was ostensibly existed to defend the empire against subversion, particularly against what it thought was Jewish subversion, when they also argued that the prominence of Jews in revolutionary movements but somehow proved that this was in some way a Jewish revolution.

But again, this is not a mainstream newspaper, it''s not appealing to a mainstream population very people saw it, but this is where it appears.

Now, keep in mind, that''s two or three years before it''s usually said to have been written, or the other version is that there''s this crazy priest by the name of Sergei Nielis and he wrote it, or he had actually handed it as an appendix to his work.

in 1905.

Now it was it was around before that.

So Nielis didn''t create it.

It wasn''t drafted in Paris in 1904 or 1905.

It was serialized in an obscure right wing Russian newspaper 1903.

And by the way we should say that these are 24 protocols.

Well it varies.

It varies.

that are, I guess, supposed to be like meeting notes about the supposed cabal where the Jews and Freemasons are planning together a world domination, but it''s like meeting notes, right?

Protocol or what''s your Russian term basically for notes of a meeting?

Yeah.

Well, it''s notes of a meeting is the goofiest things I''ve ever seen because what you''ve gone here, it''s not notes.

No one takes notes from a meeting that way.

What you''ve got is like the exposition of a bond villain.

Right.

Yes, all of this, all of them are going to do this.

And then the last thing you want to do is lay out your, if you get a plan for world domination, my suggestion would be don''t write it down.

So it''s not notes of a meeting.

It''s again, it''s another sort of narrative or story that''s being told.

It bears no resemblance to the dialogue and hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu.

But what it is, the best thing, it''s not particularly readable in some ways.

There was an Italian writer and then Chaserai Mikkailas, who wrote a book, translated in English called the non-existent manuscript.

And what it is is that he takes the different versions, starting with the 1902, 1903 versions, and looks through the other ones, and he tries to process to reconstruct what he thinks the original might have been.

But the other thing he does, which was fascinating to me, is that he takes This whole sort of initial text and in bold type, he indicates the paragraphs, but more often sentences or phrases that appear to be identical from the Joli work.

And they''re just scattered throughout it.

There''s no particular rhyme or reason to it.

You don''t plagiarize that way.

I mean, who does that?

It''s sentence here, sentence there, which is led to a peculiar theory of mine, which of course I will have to expound upon, which is that I think that the original author of the protocols was the same Maurice Jolie.

I think what someone stumbled across was a work which he wrote and never published, and which he just drew.

It''s exactly what someone would do, working from your own kind of material.

Because I''ve written things and then taken what I''ve written and then repackaged that into something else.

And the same sort of thing comes out, only bits and pieces of it remain.

So, why would Joli have done that?

Joli was, or talking about a man whose career basically expand the 1850s to 1870s.

He''s an obscure figure.

I''m not even totally sure he existed.

I mean, but it''s one of those things you go looking for him.

I love that you''re a scholar of people that just kind of emerged out of like the darkness.

They just they just come from nowhere.

And there''s the crown of there also.

And we should also say this was I guess the original would I mean, what''s the language of the original?

Russian?

Russian.

But my hunch is that that''s adopted from a French version.

First of all, they''re constantly harping on free maces, which isn''t nearly as big an idea as they''re there.

If you go back to France in the 1890s, there''s some big scandals.

Well, there''s the Drifus scandal that we got that.

All right, well, you''ve got a Jewish officer on trial for being a traitor, all right?

So that was pro.

So you bring in the whole Jewish element, juice is disloyal, Drifus case 1894.

Earlier you had the Panama scandal, which was this huge investment scandal when the Panama Canal Company in Paris collapsed and again many of the major players in that work Jewish financiers.

And then you''ve got the taxal hoax.

So the taxal hoax was the work of this guy, his real name was, I think, Joghan Paje.

He was kind of a French journalist.

He started out writing porn.

So when he wrote things like sex lives of the popes and, you know, the erotic bible and various things of that kind, he was a Catholic, broke with the Catholic church, wrote bad stuff about the popes, and apparently became a Freemason for a while, and then supposedly recanted his evil ways, went back to the church, and then under the name Leo Taxil began writing these whole series of articles, basically arguing that there was a Masonic satanic conspiracy, run by the way by an American, Albert Pike.

And this also included child sacrifice.

It''s got pizzeria, and it is wealth by a high priestess, Diana von.

And so there''s like child sacrifice, you know, weird roby bohemian grove stuff.

And the Freemasons are devil worshippers going back to the night''s Templars.

And so there''s a thing called the devil in the 19th century in the secrets of Freemasonry.

And this became a bestseller in France.

So France is just obsessed with all these all these kinds of conspiracy.

So evil Satanic Freemasons, evil Jewish financiers, Drifus.

Yes, this is the brew where all of this comes out.

I want to figure out how Freemasons and Jews get connected together.

France is the place where this happens.

Now, taxil, or Jogampage, eventually pulls another interesting thing in this.

Around 1897, critics argue that he''s making this stuff up and demand that he present Diana Vaughn, supposed satanic, high priestess, toddler killer.

And he says, oh, we''re gonna have a press conference.

She''ll appear and say all of this stuff as she returns to the church and, you know, possibly becomes a nun.

And so people show up, you know, I''ve figured some of the Catholic church shows up and he does no Diana Vaughn and Dogan Pestay goes, it''s all a hoax, I made it up.

You''re all a bunch of idiots for believing it.

Okay, you, you members of the church, especially, just a little bit gullible, you know, morons you are.

And that''s it.

He confesses it to this day, however, you will find people who will insist that it''s actually true because they desperately want it to be true.

But this is, I think, the milieu that, I like that word, apparently, that this comes out of, and this is this is this whole kind of unhealthy mix.

So, France, to me, is the only place then in the decade preceding it that something like this would be concocted.

So it was either created by some sort of unknown person there, but I still think that even though he dies in like 1879, that in Maurice Jolie''s troubled career, he went from being an opponent of French emperor Napoleon III, which is what the whole dialogues was written against.

And then he was, for a time, a close political ally of a French politician by the name of Adolf Cremieux.

So Adolf Cremieux, well, what''s he got going for?

And while he was kind of a radical politician, he was an opponent of Napoleon III.

He was a free Mason.

Oh, and he was Jewish.

' comes out of, and this is this is this whole kind of unhealthy mix.

So, France, to me, is the only place then in the decade preceding it that something like this would be concocted.

So it was either created by some sort of unknown person there, but I still think that even though he dies in like 1879, that in Maurice Jolie''s troubled career, he went from being an opponent of French emperor Napoleon III, which is what the whole dialogues was written against.

And then he was, for a time, a close political ally of a French politician by the name of Adolf Cremieux.

So Adolf Cremieux, well, what''s he got going for?

And while he was kind of a radical politician, he was an opponent of Napoleon III.

He was a free Mason.

Oh, and he was Jewish.

In fact, at I think he was actually the head both of the Scottish right in France, and I have been an important figure in the Alliance, Israeli, the Jewish organization in France.

So he was publicly, very prominently Jewish and Masonic.

So someone else who would have linked them to get, Joli, as he did with virtually everyone, This is a guy whose life largely consisted of dual threats and fist fights.

So he gets angry at Cormue.

And it''s exactly the type of thing that he might write to vent his spleen about it.

But he died.

Probably a suicide.

That''s kind of difficult to tell.

In obscurity, his son seems to have inherited most of his literary works.

And his son then worked for New became a journalist to work for newspapers in France in the 1890s, but was also associated with some people on the fringes of the Okrona or the Russian press in France.

So one of the little things that had happened by this time is that France and Russia had become allies, even though their political systems were completely incompatible.

And so the Russians were using money to subsidize French newspapers that were championing the alliance between the two, Russian meddling, okay.

Now, they''re just paying to have the right kind of newspapers come out.

So there''s this whole connection between the kind of Russian journalistic world and the French journalistic world and all of these scandals which are going on and jolly sun and then, you know, 10 years down the road, this thing pops up in a newspaper and St. Peter''s bird.

That''s where I think the origins lay.

Why do you think it took off?

Why do you think it grabbed a large number of people''s imaginations?

And even after it was shown to be not actually what it''s supposed to be, people still believe it''s real.

Well, it doesn''t take off immediately.

Okay, it never receives any kind of wide.

I mean, nobody much reads the first edition of it.

When it''s re-edited, it keeps getting, there is something like 18 or 19 different versions as it goes through.

I mean, it gets, you know, people leave this protocol out or leave another one.

As time goes on, there''s more and more emphasis on Jews and less and less on Freemasons.

So it''s sort of, and the whole thing could have begun as an anti-masonic tract.

You could leave Jews out of it entirely and just turn it into a Masonic plot to rule the world.

But let''s just throw them in, as well, since the two things are already being combined elsewhere.

It doesn''t become a big deal until really after the first World War, because the initial versions of it are all in Russian, and let''s face it, well, that''s widely read in Russia.

It''s not much read anywhere else.

It''s a different alphabet.

Nobody can even see what it means.

So it has no particular influence outside of Russia, but then you get to 1919 and you get all these different versions of it.

So suddenly you get two English versions in the US, another English version in Britain, a German edition, a French edition, a Dutch edition.

everybody is coming up with these things.

So it''s not until I mean the immediate aftermath of the First World War that this metastasizes and it begins to show up in all of these different foreign editions.

And I think that it just has to do with the changes that have taken place during the war.

One of the things that people began looking for was that why was there a war?

And we just had this This whole disastrous war in the world has been turned upside down.

So there has to be some kind of explanation for that.

I don''t know.

And one of the things this offer to see, there''s this evil plan.

There''s this evil plan that has been put into motion.

And this could possibly explain what''s taking place.

The reason with the protocols were, I think, widely bought then and where they still are many ways is the same reason that the taxhole hoax I was talking about was because it told a story that people wanted to believe.

So in France in the 1890s, there was widespread suspicion of Freemasons.

It was seen as a somewhat sinister secretive organization, certainly secretive.

And there was also the same sort of generalized prejudices about Jews, clannish, distinct, too much influence, all of the things that went on.

So it was sort of easy to combine those two things together.

And even though taxal admits it was a hoax, There were those who argued that this is just too, it''s too accurate.

It describes things too completely to be a hoax.

And then you get the same arguments.

In fact, I''ve heard the same arguments with a protocol.

I don''t even buy this as an example of plagiarism because you can''t actually prove what''s being plagiarized in any sense.

To me, the protocols are a prime example of what I call a turd on a plate.

These things crop up.

I have to explain that now, but I have to wait.

What has it turned on a plate?

Well, it turned on a plate is a turd on a plate.

Suppose you come in and there''s a plate sitting on the table and there''s a turd on it.

Now the first thing you''re going to want is, is that a turd?

Is it a human turd?

Where did it come from?

Who is, why would someone poop on a plate?

There are all these questions that come demand.

It makes no sense.

But that''s what you come, it''s just there.

Right?

I don''t know where it came from.

I don''t know why, but there''s a turd on a plate.

And that''s what the protocols are.

They''re just there.

But the reality is just like with a turd on a plate, you take a picture of that in modern day and it becomes a meme, becomes viral and becomes a joke on all social media.

And now it''s viewed by tens of millions of people or whatever, it becomes popular.

So wherever the theory came from, it did captivate the imagination.

Yeah.

It did speak to something.

Was it seemed to provide an explanation?

Can you just speak to Jew hatred?

Is it just an accident of history?

Why was it the Jews versus the Freemasons?

Is it the collective mind searching for a small group to blame for the pains of civilization?

And then Jews just happened to be the thing that was selected at that moment in history?

It goes all the way back to the Greeks.

Let''s blame them.

So one of the first Just occasions you find the idea that Jews are a distinct, mean-spirited, nasty people.

Goes back to and a Greco-Egyptian historian named Manito.

This is around, I think, 300 BC.

early, can''t even rope the Romans into this one.

Some Anitho is trying to write a history of the dynasties of Egypt.

I think his history of dynasties of Egypt still was one of the basic works in this, but he tells this whole story which essentially describes the kind of first blood libels that the Jews to celebrate their various religious holidays would capture Greeks and fatten them up in the basement and then slaughter them and eat them or drain their blood or do something.

Yeah, it''s just the sort of really your version of that time.

Also, I think it repeats the sort of Egyptian version of the Exodus out of Egypt, which is quite different than the biblical version.

In this case, the Egyptian, they worked as they stole all the stuff out of the Egyptian''s houses and ran off into the desert.

The Jews stole all the stuff and ran off.

Yeah, Hebrews.

Hebrews robbed the Egyptians, they were taken in, you know, we took them in and sheltered them, gave them jobs, and then they like stole all the jewelry and ran away.

We didn''t even chase them.

We were glad to see them gone.

So it''s a different narrative on that story.

But it essentially portrays the Jews as being hostile, you know, that they don''t like other people.

They''re contemptuous of other people''s religions, the rest of it.

And see, the Greeks tended to think of themselves as being extremely cosmopolitan.

Now, the Greeks run across people worshipping other gods.

They go, oh, this is just our gods and her different names.

Okay, everything was sort of adjusted into their landscape.

So you ended with that kind of hostility, which was there at the time, and that was probably influenced also by some of these earlier rebellions that had taken place in Egypt.

During the Roman period, you not only have the Judean rebellion in 70 AD, but you have a couple of other uprisings in North Africa and very bloody affairs, and in some cases Jews begin massacering other people around them.

They start killing the Greeks, the Greeks start killing them.

So there was a fair amount of, from that period on, a certain amount of bad blood of mutual contempt between Greeks or between hellings, between the people who became Hellenized as the Romans would be, and the Jews.

And the Romans also seemed to develop much of that idea.

They considered Judea as being a horrible place to have to govern, inhabited by a stubborn, obnoxious people.

Not well liked.

So that''s really where you see the earliest version of that.

And the reasons for it would be complicate.

What you could say is that going back to Manito and to the Roman period, Jews, Judeans frequently experienced difficulties, conflicts with other people living around them.

And part of that probably had to do with the diaspora, which was the movement.

Well, you know, you get the idea that the Romans came and he kicked everybody out, which they didn''t.

Jews had been leaving Judea since it was a poor limited area and moving into areas like North Africa, Egypt, or an acre all the way into southern France.

They moved widely around the Roman Empire.

So that sense of both distinctness and hostility existed since ancient times.

So it wasn''t just the attitude of the church towards Jews was mixed by, well, one of the ideas, of course, is that at the end of time, you know, just before the second coming, One of the signs, how are we going to know that Jesus is going to return and the world is going to end?

Well, the Jews will all convert.

There will be a mass conversion, they''ll sort of see the light.

Now, so there have to be Jews around to do that, or we won''t, you know, it''s like a canary in a coal mine.

You have to have them there to tip it off.

So that was one of the arguments as to why within the church, as to why Jews would not be forcibly converted.

beyond the fact that it''s just kind of bad policy to forcibly convert people because you don''t know whether it''s sincere, but they need to be preserved as a kind of artifact which will then redeem itself at the end of time.

It''s not something which is encouraged, it predates Christianity.

And then Christianity, of course, in its own way, just sort of plagiarizes the whole Jewish thing, doesn''t it?

I mean, I hesitate to use that term, but that''s what you do.

It''s just like, well, we''re the Jews now.

Okay, you used to have a unique relationship with God, but now it''s been passed over to us.

And so, you know, thanks for the Bible.

You know, I can remember that.

And my mom''s side, I was periodically exposed to Sunday school.

And pretty much the Old Testament was always presented as if somehow it was the, you know, the history of like, with lack of better term, you know, Europeans in some way.

It was sort of a Christian history.

It was all the prequel to that.

And there''d be some sort of, first the term Hebrew was always used, never Jews.

So the ancient Hebrews, and somehow the Hebrews just sort of became the Christians.

And I don''t know, the Jews just got, they didn''t get a memo or something.

So it''s basically like Christianity, the prequel, is the Old Testament.

But they just sort of take over.

Okay, we have the special dispensation now.

Thank you very much.

You''re an artifact.

So it''s interesting.

So this whole narrative that I would say is that was kind of like a viral meme started as you described in 300 BC and just carried on various forms and morphed itself and arrived after the Industrial Revolution into it in a new form to the 19th and 20th century.

And then somehow captivated everybody''s imagination.

I think that modern anti-Semitism is very much a creation of the modern world and the industrial revolution.

It''s largely a creation of Jewish emancipation.

It''s the nasty flip side of that.

All of the restrictions that are thrown off, but now also you become the focus of much more attention that what you had before.

Prior to that, you had the kind of ghettoization, which worked both ways.

Rabbis who praised the ghetto is a protection of Jews against the outside world, because inside we can live our life as we wish and we''re unmolested.

Whereas if we were the great fears that if we were sort of absorbed into this larger world, we''ll lose our identity.

That sort of question comes up in the 18th century and things like the Haskell movement in Germany, because the German Jews were always at the sort of cutting edge of assimilation and mordernity and Moses Mendelssohn was an example of that.

You are arguing that you know, we just need to become Germans.

So, you know, as much as possible synagogue should we look like Lutheran churches, everything you think should be given in good German, and that''s the way we need to become Jewish Germans.

We don''t we don''t want to become a kind of group of people who are who are a part in that way and that It''s created great tensions Ever since you know one of the essential points.

It seems to me in anti-Semitism Anti-Jewism is that all the Jews are in us together.

Isn''t that one of the things?

Okay, they''re always talking about as if they''re collective Jews this Jews that as if it''s it''s a single undifferentiated mass of people who all move and speak in the same way.

From my personal experience, not being Jewish, I''ve incredibly diverse.

In many ways really, one of the things that anti-Semitism proposes is a continuity or singularity of Jewish identity that never existed.

Just like you said, in one hand, there''s a good story, in the other hand, it''s the truth, and oftentimes, the good story wins out, and there''s something about the idea that there''s a cabal of people, whatever they are, in this case, our discussion is Jews seeking world domination, controlling everybody, is somehow a compelling story.

It gives us a direction of a people''s, to fight, of people''s to hate, on which we project our pain because life is difficult, life for many, for most is full of suffering.

And so we channel that suffering into hatred towards the other.

Maybe if you can just zoom out, what do you from this particular discussion learn about human nature that we pick the other in this kind of way?

and we divide each other up in groups and then construct stories and like constructing those stories and they become really viral and sexy to us and then we channel the hatred.

We use those stories to channel hatred towards the other.

Well you know Jews don''t think only a recipient of that I mean any any time you hear people talking about Jews disser that white people disser that black people this or that, Asians this or that, were it they''re an undifferentiated mass, who apparently all share something in common.

Well, then nobody''s really thinking.

The other thing you''ll find is that people who will express those views when press will argue that, oh, well, this, you know, if they actually know anybody from those groups, those are okay.

It''s like Nazis.

Oh, they go, this isn''t okay, They were always being constantly making exceptions and one for what they actually met an actual human being, and they seemed to be fairly normal while they were okay.

So what it was that they hated weren''t actual people for the most part, it was just this kind of golly-wag vision that they had of them, you''re not even talking about real people.

I don''t know.

What does that tell you about human nature?

Well, okay.

In 70 odd years, what have I learned about my fellow creatures?

One, I don''t actually understand them any better than I ever did.

In fact, less so.

Okay.

I would say this.

When I was 17, I thought I had the world much more figured out than I do now.

Completely deleted.

But you know, It seemed to make much more sense, and I could categorize things.

Basic take upon human beings, most people, most of the time, are polite, cooperative, and kind until they''re not.

And the exact tipping point and moment in which they go from one to the other is unpredictable.

God that''s brilliantly put.

Speaking of the tipping point, you gave a series of lectures on murderers, crimes in the 20th century.

One of the crimes that you described is the Manson family murders.

And that combines a lot of the elements of what we''ve been talking about and a lot of the elements of the human nature that you just described.

So can you just tell the story at a high level as you understand it?

The Manson Philly.

What do you begin with Charles Manson?

Who''s the key element in this?

And Charles Manson, for most of his life, up until the time, that he''s around 33, is an unexceptional petty criminal.

In and out of prison, reform school from an early age, not really associated with violent crimes, he did stuff like steel cars, right bad checks, became an unsuccessful Pimp and Drug Dealer.

So around 1967 he gets out of his latest stint in federal walk-up and terminal island during Los Angeles, California.

By that time he''s learned how to play the guitar, has ambitions to become a musician, and also has proclaimed himself a Scientologist.

Not that he ever seems to have practiced, but that''s what he would claim that he was.

Kind of, you know, self-educated himself in prison to a certain degree.

And so when he gets out of prison in 67, he was a model prisoner.

He behaved himself, you know, and seemed.

You can sort of imagine his life is going into completely different direction.

And here again, I''m going to say something kind of good about Charles Madsen, which is that he actually was a decent singer.

If you really sort of listen to some of the stuff he did.

You know, he''s not a great singer, but he could have, you know, other people got recording contracts with less talent than he had, and they could play guitar.

The Beach Boys actually do record one of his songs without him.

How would you evaluate Hitler''s painting?

On compared to Charles''s man.

Well, you''re supposed to say it''s terrible.

Okay.

Okay.

It looks average to me.

Yeah.

It''s landscape.

I mean, If you didn''t know it was Hitler, would it, would it, would it, would you, I don''t know what people will say about it.

Sorry for the distractions.

It''s just, you know, it''s just an average painter.

That''s what it was.

Something like crazy genocidal maniac paintings that you don''t have really have those.

So Manson, you could have done that.

He probably could have, you know, he made certain inroads into the music industry.

And if you hadn''t been such a weirdo, he his life could have taken a different turn.

So this is one of the questions I have.

Where did a guy who becomes, who''s an unexceptional career petty criminal, suddenly emerge into some sort of criminal mastermind, a Sven Golly, who can bend all of these people to his will and get them to go out and commit murder?

That''s a real shift that you have.

So the first thing it kind of could tell you that something odd is going on, as he gets out of prison in LA County.

And he''s on parole.

You know, parolees are supposed to have a job, not supposed to leave the jurisdiction of their parole.

He had straight for the Bay Area, violates parole right off the bat.

Two weeks later, he drifts into the parole office in the Bay Area, whereupon he should have been arrested and sent back to terminal island.

But instead, They just assigned him a parole.

I don''t know.

Maybe things were easier then in some way.

So he gets assigned a parole officer Michael Smith Michael Smith is initially handling a number of parolees, but after a while once he takes on Manson He only has one parole.

He''s supervising Charlie Manson, which is odd And he also find out that Michael Smith in addition to being a parole officer is a graduate student at the University of California studying group dynamics, especially the influence of drugs on gangs in groups, and he''s also connected to the Hay and Ashbury free clinic, which is a place where the influence of because Hay and Ashbury had lots of drugs and lots of groups.

groups.

So, you know, Charlie Manson never gets a regular job, hangs around with young girls, ex-cons, engages in criminal activity, is repeatedly arrested but nothing ever sticks for the next couple of years.

So who gets that type of thing?

Who gets it get out of jail free card in formats.

So here is what, again, this is speculation, but Manson at some point after he got out of prison is getting this treatment because he is recruited as a confidential informant.

For who?

For who?

That''s the interesting question.

So, probably not for any local police departments, my best suspicion is probably the federal Bureau of Narcotics, precursor to the DEA.

Yeah, federal paroleee, federal parole officer come graduate student in drugs and group dynamics and eventually with permission he goes back down to L.A. and what is he part of when he''s there?

Well, he''s on the fringes of the music industry.

Not so much, you know, these those the Wilson''s and elsewhere, which also brings him to the fringes of the film industry.

So one of the things if you''re sort of looking in terms of Hollywood music industry elites in the flow of, oh, and he''s also dealing in drugs and girls.

So an early version of Jeffrey Epstein.

Yeah, a mass-interracted lots of underage runaways and train them, use them also associating with biker gangs who produce the drugs, etc.

So that''s part of what.

He''s an, he''s an informant in the movement of drugs basically within the film music industries.

And he''s given pretty much a kind of free grain at that point.

What then happens in August of 1969 is that there are these murders, you know, first, Sharon Tate and her friends in the Cielo Drive.

I think everybody is probably pretty much heard that story before, And of course, the question is, why Cielo drive, why Sharon Tate for Koski and the rest of him, that he had some, Manson was familiar with the place he had been there before.

Members of the family had been there before.

So he knew where it was.

It wasn''t an easy place to find.

May the way that that house, the original house is no longer there, but the same sort of property in a house is built there.

And if you didn''t know where it was, it''s not some place.

Let''s just go for a drive in the Hollywood Hills and murder people in a house.

Well, that isn''t one that you would come across.

There are lots of connections there.

Voitek Frakowski, who was one of the people killed at the CLO Drive House, was involved in drug dealing.

That''s a possible connection between the two, probably a fairly likely one.

Probably not unfortunate, shearantate at all.

She was probably in the wrong place at the wrong time, her husband might have been, you never know.

And then the next night, after the slaughter there, which by the way, Manson is not at.

So this is one of the interesting things about it.

Charles Manson doesn''t kill any of these people.

He has crimes supposedly ordering the killings to be done.

He supposedly thought that the killings at the Tate House were sloppy.

And he was going to give everybody a crash course in how you apparently commit seemingly random murders.

So the next night he takes group of people over to the La Bianca''s house in a different section of LA.

And you''ve got Lena Rosemary, La Bianca, a guy who''s a grocer, his wife runs a dress shop, upper middle class, and they''re bound to gagged and hacked a death as at the tape residence various things like Piggy or Ritten, you know, various messages just in blood things that are supposed to look like cats paws because one of the grooves trying to be framed for this was the idea was the black panthers.

So the general story that comes out in the subsequent trial is that this was all a part of something called Helter Skelter, which Manson supposedly was an idea that that sounds like a Beatles song that''s where he got it from.

He thought the Beatles were talking to him through their music and that there was going to be an apocalyptic race war.

And this was all part of a plan to set this off.

So this is why the black panthers were trying to be implicated in this.

Although how it was supposed to do that is never really explained.

Here is what I think was really happening.

What really happened and how I think it fits together.

Before Sharon Tate and her friends or the La Bianca''s were killed, there was a murder by members of the family of some of the same people involved in the later killings of a musician, drug manufacturer by the name of Gary Hinman.

So Massin again was involved in the drug trade And Hinman made them.

He was a cook, basically.

And he brewed them up in his basement, sold the drugs to Manson, who sold them to biker gangs like the Straight Satan''s, which was one of the groups that he used, and they distributed them elsewhere.

Well, one day, the Straight Satan show up and complained that the last batch of math or whatever it was that they got from Madison, he had made some of their brothers very, very ill and they were quite unhappy about that and they wanted their $2,000 back.

Madison had gotten those drugs from Gary Hinman.

So he is unhappy and he sends Bobby Bose away and a couple of the girls over to Hinman''s place to get the money from him.

As the story is related, I think, by Susan Atkins, Hinman denied that there was anything wrong with his drugs and refused to pay up, which led to an interrogation torture session in which he was killed.

And the idea was here, what are we going to do with that?

Well, one of the other groups that Hinman had sold drugs to were, guess what, people associated with a black panther.

So we''ll leave these things up and we''ll make they will do it.

So it''s Bobby Bosele who then takes Hinman''s car and decides to drive it up the coast.

By the way with a bloody knife with Hinman''s blood and hair on it and blood on the seats in the car and then he pulls it off the road and decides to sleep it off and it gets busted.

right.

So find Hinman''s body, find Bosele and Hinman''s car with a bloody knife with him.

Yeah, he''s arrested.

So Bosele was very popular with some of the girls.

There''s consternation in the family that Bobby has been arrested.

So how can we possibly get Bobby out of jail?

Copycat killings.

So, if we go kill more people and we make it look the same, then see, body couldn''t possibly have done it.

Now, see, he just borrowed the car, yeah, okay, he stole the car, but the knife was already in it.

He didn''t have anything to do with this.

So, that, to me, makes the most sense out of what followed.

How often do people talk about that theory?

That''s an interesting theory.

Well, it''s there.

It''s just not the one that, that Boogley-Oce wanted to go with Helter''s scouter because because it was, again, it was a story that people could understand and it was sensational and it would catch on.

Also another probable issue in that was that his star witness was Linda Cassabian.

Linda Cassabian, she was present at both the Tate and La Bianca murders.

She didn''t participate in the killings according to her.

She sort of drives the car, but everybody else talked about what had happened.

Well, okay, she turns state evidence and gets total immunity, and it''s largely on her testimony that all the rest of the case is based.

Now, if you start throwing into the equation that she proclaimed her love for Bobby Bosele, and that she, according to others, was the chief proponent of the copycat killings?

Well, then that would get messy.

Now, there''s one guy at the center of this.

It''s Charles Manson.

He ordered all of this done to ignite a race war even though how would any of that do it?

Okay.

So that doesn''t make sense.

But he is nevertheless at the center of this because he''s the glue of the family, right?

He exerts a tremendous amount of psychological control over them.

How was he able to do that?

Sorry to interrupt.

Like what?

because he said he was a petty criminal.

It does seem he was pretty prolific in his petty crimes.

Like he did a lot of them.

He had a lot of access to LSD.

Okay, okay.

Which he started getting at the free clinic in San Francisco.

So lots of it floating around.

Some descriptions of the family at Spawn Ranch is that people were basically taking acid on a daily basis, which by the way was also a potential problem with Linda Kisebi in this testimony since she also admitted to being high most of the time and also thinking she was a witch.

All right, so you want to put her?

Okay, where do you want to go with that?

See, if Manson wasn''t Manson, if he hadn''t acted like such a complete...

If he hadn''t actually acted like the crazed hippy psycho goofball that Bugliosi painted him as being, then Cassabian''s testimony wouldn''t have been as strong because you could.

I mean, the first thing against her is you''ve gotten immunity for telling the story of the prosecution once.

Yeah, that''s a little iffy.

And we wouldn''t even bring in the witch and the drugs and being in love with Bobby Boseley, aren''t.

So if Manson had been dressed like you sitting there in a suit and tie an inel and hand it behaved himself and spoken normally, things might, this isn''t to say that he wasn''t guilty as hell.

So what he supposedly did was to inspire all of these killings.

And I think that''s probably, you know, sort of beginning with the Hinman killing.

He told them to go over there and get the money, one way or the other.

I don''t know whether there''s clear where they told him if you don''t get the money, kill him, but Hinman''s dead.

And then, it might also see the value in terms of having copycat killings as a way of throwing off any other kind of blame.

The other story you get is that one of the people who had lived at the Cielo House for Sharon Tate was before, who was a record producer by the name of Terry Melcher.

Melcher supposedly is the general story goes head welched on a deal with Manson in terms of a record contract.

He screwed over Manson in some sort of a record deal and Manson wanted to get revenge and sent him to kill everybody in the house.

Which again doesn''t make him much of a sense.

One, Manson knew that Melcher wasn''t living there anymore.

He probably knew where Melcher was living.

If he wanted to get Melcher, he could have found him.

It wasn''t that difficult to do.

And so that''s, it''s not Revenge on Terry Melcher that drew him there.

He was familiar with the house, so if the idea was to simply commit random killings that would throw, it would muddy the whole waters with the henman killing, then you might pick some place you knew of, you knew the place with the running out there would be someone there you really didn''t care.

And the same way that the lobbyonka seemed to have been, Manson was familiar with that because it supposedly had been the scene of creepy crawling.

This is little interesting things that this fan will be taught to do, creepy crawling.

Yes, when you sneak into somebody''s house at night While they''re there a sleep or when they''re not there and you move things around So when they get up in the morning or they come home They''ll suddenly notice that someone has been in their house, which will Freak them out, which is the whole point of that But it doesn''t seem like the murder or the creepy crawling was the creepy crawling made me but it doesn''t seem like the murder other, like some of the other people you''ve covered like the zodiac killer, the murder is the goal.

Maybe there''s some psychopathic kind of artistry to the murder that the zodiac killer had and the messaging behind that.

But it seems like with the, at least the way you''re describing it with Charles Manson family, the murder was just, they just had a basic disregard for human life and the murder was a consequence of operating in the drug underworld.

So Manson set up a kind of base, I think, called the spawn movie wrench, which was an old movie wrench out on the northwest edge of L.A. And they just kind of camped out there.

He used the girls in particular squeaky from to get the owner or operator.

I think George spawned to let them hang out there, and basically she slept with him and he was perfectly happy to let them hang out.

They also had a place out of the desert that they had.

They dealt in credit card fraud, stolen cars.

It was kind of a shop shop that they ran out of the place.

So you had a fairly good little criminal gig going, which with the protection he had probably would, the one thing they couldn''t cover him on was murder.

So you think there was, if he was an informer, you think there was still a connection between DA, FBI, CIA, whatever, with him throughout this until you come to murder?

The real question is, there is a book written on this by Tom O''Neill, Colqueos.

And not a certain thing.

It''s the easiest thing to get through.

There''s a lot of material there.

I don''t think O''Neill necessarily knows what to make of some of the stuff he came up with.

But he does a very good job of sort of demolishing the whole Buglio scenario.

And one of the people he mentions is a name that I had run into elsewhere, and so I really paid attention to it when I saw it again, and the name is Reeve Whitson.

Reeve Whitson shows up on the fringes, even though he has no judicial function.

He sort of hangs around Booly Aussie in the prosecution, he''s some sort of advice.

He''s just kind of there.

In the same way that he was one of these guys, you know, he grew his hair kind of long or bell bottoms hung around the music Community and elsewhere in Hollywood, but no one could tell you exactly what he did I Know what he did later, but a decade later he shows up as a CIA officer in Central America Hmm So, Reeve Wittsen, later in his career at least, is CIA.

What was he in 1969?

What is he doing in this?

The other thing about it is he appears to have been the person who called this little question when the bodies at C.H.L.O. drive are discovered.

So the general story is that Sharon Tate''s housekeeper shows up around 8.30 in the morning flies a bloody scene and goes screaming next door But there was another fellow who knew I think the owner of the house is a photographer Lesson may be Hattami.

He gets a call earlier in the morning saying that there''d been murders there And the person he would call it''s calling him is Reeve Whitson So someone had been at the house Before the bodies were discovered and they had not called the police So I don''t know what''s going on there, but he''d say It''s a curious kind of of situation And Manson in a lot of ways just kind of self immolates himself I mean, his behavior at the trial is bizarre, it''s threatening, it''s disruptive, you know, he''s got his girls out on the street carving X''s in their forehead, carrying knives.

One of the attorneys, initially his attorney, Ron Hughes, becomes Van Halton''s attorney, and he figures out that the three girls supposedly on Charlie''s insistence are going to confess, and they''re confessed that it was all their idea and Charlie had nothing to do with it.

He wasn''t like this because his defense for her is that she was under his influence and therefore not responsible for her own actions.

He was having psychic control so he refuses to go along with it.

There''s a break in the trial.

He goes camping up in the mountains with some friends.

Disappears during a rainstorm and then some months later his decomposed remains are found.

Now rumors, always the rumors.

Okay.

What would history be without rumors?

', it''s disruptive, you know, he''s got his girls out on the street carving X''s in their forehead, carrying knives.

One of the attorneys, initially his attorney, Ron Hughes, becomes Van Halton''s attorney, and he figures out that the three girls supposedly on Charlie''s insistence are going to confess, and they''re confessed that it was all their idea and Charlie had nothing to do with it.

He wasn''t like this because his defense for her is that she was under his influence and therefore not responsible for her own actions.

He was having psychic control so he refuses to go along with it.

There''s a break in the trial.

He goes camping up in the mountains with some friends.

Disappears during a rainstorm and then some months later his decomposed remains are found.

Now rumors, always the rumors.

Okay.

What would history be without rumors?

Hell that, uh, he members of the family, they were, they were, they were pissed off at Ron Hughes because he messed up Charlie''s idea to get him off and so they killed him.

Maybe they did.

Maybe he drowned.

That''s, that''s absolutely impossible to say.

You got that kind of story.

There''s a guy named Juan Flynn, who was an employee at the spawn ranch, didn''t like Manson.

He held Manson responsible for the murder of his boss.

He would testify that Manson told him that he had ordered all the killings, and that Manson also admitted that he had killed 35 people.

Maybe he did, on the other hand, Juan Flynn didn''t like him, And he had no other than his word, had no real proof of what he was saying.

So, please understand me in this case, is that unlike some people who argue that Charles Manson got a raw deal, I don''t think that''s the case.

I think that he influenced tremendous influence over the people there through drugs, through who sex was another frequent component in it.

He had a real whammy over a lot of these people''s minds.

I''m not sure how, that still kind of puzzles me.

He was a scrawny guy, and he wasn''t physically intimidating.

I mean, even a lot of women wouldn''t be physically intimidated by him, but he nonetheless had this real psychological power, and if you look around him, the male followers he had wasn''t a really big guy.

So he could get people to do what he wanted.

And again, to me, the simplest explanation for this is that it began with the henman killing and probably on Manson''s instigation, the others were copycat killings to throw off what was going on.

That would, if I was a cop, that''s what I would focus on because that seems to make the most sense.

It''s still as fascinating that he''s able to have that much psychological control over of those people without having a very clear ideology.

So it''s a cult.

Yes, the great focus on Charlie the leader, the excessive devotion.

But there''s not an ideology behind that, like something like Scientology or some kind of religious or some kind of, I don''t know, utopian ideology, nothing like this.

No, I think that Manson again was essentially a criminal.

get a sociopathic mindset and he''s hit upon a pretty good deal.

Yeah, but like, how do people convince anybody of anything with the, with the call, usually you have either an ideology or you have maybe personal relations like you said sex and drugs, but underneath that, can you really keep people with sex and drugs?

You have to kind of convince them that you love them in some deep sense, like there''s a, like a commune of love.

You have a lot of people there in the cult.

They have some sort of we like to call dysfunctional families.

A lot of the females in particular seem to have come from, you know, more or less middle-class families, but those are full of dysfunction.

You know, their parents didn''t love them.

There are semi-runaways and now they had this whole family.

A lot of the younger women had children.

You know, some of them by Manson, some of them by the others, they sort of bonded together.

And again, we return to that pull towards belonging that gets us humans into trouble.

So it does seem that there were a few crimes around this time.

So zodiacular.

Well, California, I''m from, so I remember this period vividly.

So by the way, the Tate La Bionca killings occurred on my birthday, the year I graduated from high school.

So I remember this.

Happy birthday.

A term which has been used for that, there''s a writer with the name of Todd Wood who''s toyed, I wish I''d come up with this killer for ya.

And which is just sort of a chronicle of the serial killers and disappearances in the late 60s and 70s.

So you''ve got the zodiac, you''ve got otherwise, I mean, you know, I hate to say it.

I''m not trying to be flippin'' about, but I mean young female hitchhikers were disappearing an alarming rate in Northern California.

There are bodies that have never been attributed.

something that the zodiacs victims, but it was a dangerous time.

Edmund Kemper, you know, the co-ed killer was was another one.

There were a lot of creepy psychopaths running around.

I don''t know whether it was something in the water or what was going on, but it was a menacing in some cases.

Hitchhiking, especially if you were alone and female, was not something you wanted to do in much of the Golden State, certainly not if around the Bay Area.

So, a lot of these strange sort of killings that we''re going on, the Zodiac is one of those things where you have these people who have theories about it.

And if you don''t share their theory then, you know, you''re part of the problem in some form or another.

So I''m not sure, for instance, the zodiac killings roll committed by the same person.

I think there might have been multiple people involved.

And, you know, the first killings are all of couples.

It''s very sort of clear that they, I remember in my examination of it, one of the things I was looking at specific, you know, what else is there to say about the zodiac killing.

So what I was going to look at is that there are all of these accusations that there is an occult aspect to it.

There was some sort of ritualistic aspect.

So I looked at different things, locations, victims, phases of the moon.

That''s always worth looking at.

I didn''t find much correspondence in any of those.

In one of the killings, I think the one at Lake Berriessa, he does appear in this kind of weird hooded costume.

He''s got his symbol, the sort of compass or aiming, rectical circle, with a cross through it, it can read a variety of things.

He used guns and he used knives, but he certainly had to think for couples, except in the last of the killings, wishes of a cab driver in downtown San Francisco, go, who he shoots in full view of witnesses, which is completely atypical.

And also when he was stabbing the victims, it doesn''t seem like he was very good at it.

Or if the goal was to kill them, he wasn''t very good at it because some of them survived.

Yeah, he doesn''t, he''s not particularly thorough about it.

He seems to have had much more, more of the violence seems to be directed at the females in the males.

So there''s a couple questions to ask here.

First of all, did people see his face?

There''s a composite drawing of his face, which I think is based upon the Stein killing, the cab driver killing, where there were people who saw him or who claimed that they saw him.

The other ones were all when it was fairly dark.

Right.

I''m not sure that anyone else got to look at his face.

The one that occurred in the daylight at Barrie S.A. He was wearing a mask.

So there''s something in common initially in the targeting of victims, which doesn''t in the last case.

Then after that there''s just the different cases of where there''s a pretty good case to be made of a woman who claims I think she was she and her a small child were picked up.

Her car broke down.

She got a flat tire.

She was picked up by this guy right, who she got a very sort of strange vibe from, who eventually just let her go.

Well, you know, that might have been the Zodiac, it might not have been.

You do this kind of rigorous look, saying like, okay, what is the actual facts that we know?

Like, reduce it to the thing that we know for sure.

And in speaking about his motivation, and he said that he was collecting souls.

Souls for the afterlife.

For the afterlife.

That''s kind of a culty.

Yeah, I mean, that''s what I believe is it the Vikings or the Romans, they believe this in battle.

You''re essentially making sacrificial victims and they will be your ghostly servants in the afterlife.

Do you think he actually believed that?

Who knows?

I mean, here''s the question.

was he making that up just to be scary?

Or is that what his actual, that''s what he''s saying his motivation is.

So let''s take him at face value rather than trying to wish that into the cornfield, that is to get rid of it.

Let''s just take it to face.

So he''s claiming that he''s killing these people in order to acquire slave servants in the afterlife.

He will subsequently go on to claim many more victims.

I''m not sure if 44, eventually he will have, before he just kind of vanishes.

One of the really interesting clues to me when I was looking at that case, which I didn''t find anybody else that tended to make much of it up, is that it all has to do with this kind of Halloween card that he sends to the press in San Francisco.

And it''s talking about sort of rope by gun, by fire, and there''s this whole sort of wheel.

You know, it''s like the zodiacs.

But what the West is drawn from, where he got this from, is from a Tim Holt Western comic book, published in the 1951, and you see the same thing in the cover.

It''s wheel of fortune, but with different forms of grizzly death on it and all of the things that he mentioned are shown on the cover of this So whoever put together that card saw that comic book That''s kind of an interesting clue.

So does that mean he''s a comic book collector?

When would he have I mean that is one and also before he got the idea from So he''s incorporating these things from the then there are of course his codes which people have you know Which aren''t all that difficult to decipher or probably because they weren''t meant to be The other thing that you find often with Serial or psychopathic killers.

Those are toying with the press.

I mean this goes all the way back to Jack the Ripper Now they get attention And then he just disappears course.

Why do you think he was never caught?

I think they knew it would look for.

There''s nothing much to go on.

I mean, there was a guy who was long as suspect and then eventually he tested his DNA and find it didn''t match any of the things that they''d found.

Again, it goes back to, I''m not even sure that it''s one person who''s responsible for all of them.

Well, that''s one of the interesting things you kind of bring up here and our discussion of Manson inspires this, but there does seem to be a connection, a shared inspiration between several killers here, the zodiac, the son of Sam later, and the monster of Florence.

So is it possible there''s some kind of like an underworld that is connecting these people?

Well, take the zodiac and you had his claim that he''s collecting souls for the afterlife.

There are other things that are occultish connected to that.

He may have picked some of the killing sites due to their physical location, to their position in a particular place.

If you look at the son of Sam Case, of course David Berkowitz will on and off claim that But he was part of a satanic cult that was carrying out, again, these killings, mostly of couples and young women similar to the Zodiac, and that he had only committed some of them and was witnesses that others.

And that has really created the whole idea that, yes, there is this some kind of satanic cult which engages in ritual murders.

Then if you go all the way to Florence, you''ve got murders who go on and off for a long period of time, again focusing on couples in isolated areas, which Italian prosecutors ultimately tried to connect to some kind of satanic cult, although I''m not sure they ever made a particularly strong case for that, but that element comes up in all three of them.

So you can, with a little imagination, argue that those similarities, that those things should come up in each of those cases in different places either suggest that oddly enough psychopathic criminals all sort of thinking the same way, or that there is some sort of higher element involved in this, that there''s some kind of common inspiration.

Here you come back to something similar we were talking before about do pedophiles exist, do pedophile.

I''ll say so do do satanic cults exist.

Well, they do.

Okay, there was one of my hometown, apparently quite harmless.

As far as I know, they never did anything.

you know, but there are people who, you know, robes, here we come again, robes cut the head off a check-in, naked woman is an alter, you know, you can get off on that, I suppose, if that''s your thing.

So, profess sataness exist, satanic cults exist, serial killers exist, ritual murders exist.

Are those things necessarily connected?

No. Could they be connected?

Yes.

Okay, there''s there''s nothing don''t ever tell me that something is just too crazy for people to do because that''s That''s crazy talk You''ve studied secret societies.

You''ve gave a lot of amazing lectures on secret societies It''s fascinating to look at human history through the lens of secret societies because they''ve permeated all of human history You''ve talked about form everything from the Knights Templar to Illuminati to Freemasons like we brought up Freemasons lasted a long time and Illuminati as you''ve talked about in its sort of main form lasted a short time but it''s legend.

Never gone away.

Never gone away.

So maybe like Illuminati is a really interesting one.

Who?

What was that?

Well, the Illuminati that we know started in the 1776.

In fact, you founded by a professor, Adam Weissacht.

It wasn''t initially called the Illuminati, because that''s not really the name of the organization.

It was called the Order Perfectabilists.

Apparently that changed.

Weissacht would say things like never let our organization be known under its real name anywhere, which leaves wondering what''s its real name.

So Illuminati is simply the plural of Illuminatus, which means one who was illuminated, one who has seen the light.

So in Roman times, Christian converts were Illuminati because they had seen the light.

Anyone who thinks, and there have been organizations called Illuminati, the term is not trademarked, not copyrighted.

Anybody who thinks they''ve seen the light about anything is an illuminati.

So it defines nothing.

The symbol of the order was an owl, which interestingly enough is almost identical to the owl, which is the emblem of the Bohemian club.

Oh boy.

Make of that what you will.

I don''t make that much out of it because one owl looks pretty much like another owl to me, but compare them.

You know, you got to kind of wonder about this a little, just a little thing.

Maybe there''s some kind of connection there.

So what that supposedly has to do with the connection to the goddess Minerva and the owl was sacred to her and the order and the order was the Minerval, the person who was brought in.

The number of levels changed over time.

There was a higher level for the order that people at the lower level didn''t know about.

Pretty typical for this.

But the thing about Vice-Helft was that he was quite, he was a, uh, luminous correspondent with members with his Illuminati, both during the time that it legally existed in Bavaria, and later on.

So Vice-Helft himself lives, I think, until 1830, dies in Goethe, which was ruled by an Illuminati prince, and so on.

Nothing ever happens to these.

No, no luminonis ever put the death or arrested in prison for any period of time.

What happens is that their plan, well, what was his plan?

His plan was to essentially replace all existing religions and governments in the world with one world order governed by the Illuminati.

So to do this, you had to subvert and destroy all the existing order.

And, you know, the purpose for this is to we wish to make men happy and free, but first we must make them good.

All right.

So that''s what the order is all about.

Of course, he also said things like, Oh man, is there nothing that you won''t believe?

Okay, so myth would be used in that.

Also thought women should be brought into it.

Yet a rather interesting view about that was that we should appeal to women.

And part because women have a chip on their shoulder because they''re left out of things.

So we should appeal to their vanity on that point and offer that in the future all things will be open and they will be emancipated.

So we should hold out the prospect to female emancipation to attract them because he argued in the short term there''s no better way to influence men than through women.

Get women on our side by promising the emancipation, but he made sure we''ll never actually deliver it to them because the future world will be a boys club.

So he talks about these things fairly openly and this is where you get this idea of some sort of a new world order which is to be based upon the destruction of the existing order.

So there are those who argue that there is a trail of descent that leads from Visehoff''s Illuminati to the Communist Manifesto and, in fact, Communism itself, that Marxism was simply a further restating of this idea.

And you can draw some sort of tinnitus.

I mean, the idea never entirely goes away.

The Bavarian government gets a hold of the orders in her texts.

So the story is there, deliver to them.

I think that Vice-Half gave them to him.

I think he engineered the exposure of his order because it gave him publicity.

By being exposed in Bavaria, you gained great renown and they continued to recruit after this.

and the Bavarian government actually bans the Illuminati four different times.

Why?

Because apparently the first three times didn''t work.

So the fourth one does, you can notice that it''s like papal bans on free masonry and they just go on and on and on because this clearly isn''t working.

And you actually highlight the difference between speaking of publicity that there''s a difference a gene of visibility and transparency that a secret society could be visible, it could be known about, it could be quite popular, but you could still have a secrecy within it.

You have no idea what''s going on inside.

Yeah.

It''s like a black box.

If I said a black box on this table, we can see that there''s a black box.

What''s in the black box?

A cat?

Who knows?

In fact, the secrecy might be the very thing that makes it even more popular.

Adam, vice sounds again.

There is no more, more think convincing than a concealed mystery.

give people a concealed mystery in the fuss.

So we need to make the order mysterious for that exact reason, always hold out the possibility that knowledge, special knowledge that no mere mortals have other than you will have that way.

So he senses a lot of things, the use of vanity and ego to recruit people, to influence both men and women, it''s quite sophisticated.

And as you might expect from a professor of canon law trained by Jesuits.

So I certainly don''t think that it ceased when it was banned in Bavaria because everybody just scatters and goes elsewhere, like Paris, and then you have the French Revolution.

So the idea of the Illuminati to put it crudely, the branding is a really powerful one.

And so it makes sense that it can, there''s a thread connecting it to this day, that a lot of organizations, a lot of secret societies can sort of adopt the brand.

Anybody can call it, you can go and form a club and call it the Illuminati.

And if you''re effective at it, I think it does attract Is the chicken or the egg but powerful people tend to have gigantic egos and people gigantic egos tend to like the exclusivity of secret societies and so like there''s There''s a it''s a gravitational force that pulls powerful people to the society exclusive only certain and you also notice something goes back to when we''re talking about much earlier when we''re talking about intelligence member mice ego.

He''s of recruitment and control.

That''s a great Achilles heel in human beings, the exploitation of ego.

And of course, if we go back to the conversation of intelligence agencies, it would be very efficient and beneficial for intelligence agencies to infiltrate the secret societies, because that''s where the powerful people are.

Or the secret societies to infiltrate the intelligence agency.

Oh boy.

Well, I mean, I did this actually in all the lectures.

I kind of had a sense that intelligence agencies themselves are kind of secret societies, right?

Well, it comes down, I give you my definition of secret societies, but they come down to one is that generally, their existence isn''t secret.

It''s what they do is secret.

It''s what''s in the box, as opposed to the existence of the box.

So one of the most important criteria is that they are self-selecting.

You just don''t join.

They pick you.

They decide whether or not you''re going to admit you, and oftentimes they will sort of recruit you.

Once you have been recruited, you have to pass tests and initiations.

and you also have to swear oaths of loyalty.

Those are always very, very critical.

So broadly speaking, what interests into an intelligent organization does, they decide whether you get in, you just automatically hit the job, you have to pass tests, one allied detector test, for instance.

Feel training tests, the whole variety of tests, and then you''re sworn to secrecy.

You never talk about what you do.

Ever, or there will be dire consequences.

So the method is very much the same, and also this idea of creating a kind of insular group.

Now, the organization is us, and everyone else is outside of that.

We are guardians of special knowledge.

See, this is the time to think that we generally happen if you question whatever any kind of intelligence agency did.

Well, we know things that you don''t.

Why?

Because we''re the organization that knows things.

We collect information.

We know the secrets.

We guard the secrets.

Therefore, if we tell you, you must believe us.

I have this sense that there are very powerful secret societies operating today, and we don''t really know or understand them.

And the conspiracy theories in spirit might have something to them, but are actually factually not correct.

It''s like, you know, an effective, powerful secret society or intelligence agencies He''s not going to let you know anything.

It doesn''t want you to know, right?

They''ll probably mislead you if you can send him close.

So I think, you know, the question is, what''s the most powerful or important secret society, probably the one you don''t know about, one that doesn''t advertise its existence, the one which is never known anywhere under its real name?

You''ve got things like the Bohemian Club.

up.

You''ve got the builder burgers, which is in other sort of, you know, formed in the 1950s.

Largely the creation of a guy by the name of Josef Rettinger.

Polish, mysterious, appears at a note where a schemer for years.

A man expelled from Britain, France, and the United States at one point or another.

Long active in the Mexican labor movement.

Okay.

Okay, Reddinger is mysterious figure.

In fact, I think there was even a book written about him called Eminence Grease, great Eminence, the frontman for the builder burgers was Prince Berenhardt of the Netherlands, who was at one point in Nazi, and then a Dutch freedom fighter.

Take your pick.

But Reddinger is the moving hand behind the whole thing, and I''ll be damp I''m trying to figure out who Reddinger is.

So the idea is that, well, you get like influential people in media, business, politics, and you bring them together just to talk, to try to find common answers or common questions.

It''s all very much Western European, I mean, it''s all very closely connected to NATO.

the whole concept of a kind of Atlantisist world, which is essentially the Anglo-American combine combined with Western Europe.

But you''ve got a bunch of these things.

I mean, the Castle and Foreign relations is very similar to that.

And the builder, Burgers, is an overlap with the Bohemian Club, and then you''ve got the Penae Circle, or Lescerco, which is more military, but also linked to the so-called secret gladiolium.

The idea of the Soviets over around Western Europe, there would be a stay behind organization called Gladiol, there would be these freedom fighters.

So the question I have about that is that how many secret organizations do you need?

I mean, why all these separate groups, which often seem to have the same people into them?

Yeah, there''s a, and the closer I look, the more I wonder the same question we asked about the Russian intelligence agencies is, where is the center of power?

It seems to be very hard to figure out.

Does the secrecy scare you?

Well, I guess on one level, I''m comforted that there''s somebody actually making decisions.

as opposed to today.

I mean, what do you want?

Do you want chaos or do you want everything kind of rigidly controlled?

And I don''t put much stock in the idea that there actually is some small group of people running everything because if they were, you would operate more efficiently.

I do think that there are various disparate groups of people who think that they''re running things or try to.

And that''s what concerns me more than anything else.

Well, I had to go back to them again, because if you''re bringing up, you go back to the Nazis, they had their whole idea about a new world order and they only had 12 years to do it and look what a mess they made.

I mean, look at the damage, the physical damage that can be done, by an idea inspiring a relatively small group of people controlling a nation.

Based upon some sort of racial or ideological fantasy that has no real basis in reality and yet guides their actions, it''s this differentiation that I always make and I would try to get across the students between always be clear about what you know and what you believe.

You don''t know many things.

You know your name, you know when you were born, you probably know who your father is, but that''s not absolute unless you''ve had a DNA test and only if you trust DNA a test.

So you know who your mother is?

You believe this man is your father.

Why?

Because your mother told you it was.

So you believe things generally because someone has told you this is to be true, but you don''t really know for sure.

Well, because we know so little, we tend to go by beliefs.

So we believe believe in this.

We believe in that.

You believe that your cult leaders is the answer to everything.

And it seems to be very, very easy to get people to believe things.

And then what happens is that whether or not those beliefs have any real basis in reality, they begin to influence your actions.

So here again, regrettably in some ways to bring it back to the Nazis.

What were the Nazis convinced of?

They were convinced that Jews were basically evil aliens.

That''s what it comes down to.

They weren''t really humans.

There''s some sort of evil contamination, which we must eradicate.

And they set out to do that.

And they were sure that there''s just a few problems that can be solved.

And once you solve them, that you have this beautiful utopia where everything would be just perfect.

It''d be great and we can just get there and I think it''s really strong belief and a global utopia It just never goes right It''s well there seems like impossible to know for some reason not long ago.

I was listening on YouTube to old wobbly songs The work of the world I don''t know why I know there was a whole album of wobbly songs But, and there was one of them called commonwealth of toil and it''s like most of them they''re sort of taken from gospel songs and it''s talking about in the future, you know, how wonderful everything will be in the commonwealth of toil that will be.

And these are, you know, revolutionary leftists, in this case, wobblies, but nonetheless, it''s like a prayer for communism, everything.

Now, in the future, everything will be good because the earth will be shared by the toilers and, you know, from each of the abilities of each to his knee.

And it''s this kind of sweet little song in some way.

But I''m just sort of imagining this, you know, if I was going to stage that, I''d have like this choir of children singing it with a huge hammer and sickle behind them.

Because that''s what it''s combining.

And you can think that the sentiments that express in that song, which, you know, are legitimate in some way of all the whores that that then leads to.

It is fascinating about humans, a beautiful idea on paper, an innocent little idea about a utopian future can lead to so much suffering, that''s so much destruction.

And totally the unintended consequences as you see the law of unintended consequences and we learn from it I mean, that''s why history is important.

We''ll learn from it.

Hopefully.

Do we?

Slowly or slow learn.

I''m unconvinced of that, but perhaps is speaking of unconvinced What gives you hope?

if a human beings are still here Maybe expanding out into the cosmos a thousand, five thousand, ten thousand years from now, what gives you hope about that future, about even being a possible future about it happening?

Most people are cooperative and kind most of the time.

And that''s one of those things that can usually be dependent upon and usually you''ll get back to what you put into it.

Another thing that I have like a weird fascination of watching are people who have meltdowns on airplanes.

Because that''s just bizarre.

That''s the people who will, you know, there''s some sort of psychotic break that occurs and they''ll, and it''s always going to end the same way.

The cops are going to come on a drag you off the plane.

Now, true, they''ll, and you''re going to inconvenience everybody there.

And usually at some point they don''t care about that.

That''s the one little sense of power that they have.

So they have some sort of sense of powerlessness.

And if their only way of power is just to piss off everybody else on that plane, they''re going to go ahead and do it, even though it''s going to lead nowhere for them.

And they''re similar, sometimes psychological behavior in traffic.

Oh, the road rage thing.

The road rage, yeah.

It''s fascinating.

And I bet that most, there again, those are all people who up to some point were cooperative even and kind and polite.

And then they snap.

So those are all part of the human makeup as well.

But also part of the human makeup difference between humans and chimps is the ability to get together cooperating a mass scale over an idea, create things like the Roman Empire didn''t laws that prevent us and protect us from crazy human behavior, manifestations of a man''s and type of human beings are just weird animals.

It''s not getting around.

It''s just completely peculiar.

I''m not sure that we''re all together natural.

But I think we are all together beautiful.

There is something magical about humans and I hope humans stay here even as we get advanced robots walking around everywhere.

More and more intelligent robots that claim to have consciousness that claim they love you that increasingly take over our world.

I hope this magical things that makes us human still persists.

Well, let us hope so.

Right, you''re an incredible person.

So so so much fascinating work and it''s really an I''ve never had anybody ask me is is many interesting questions Thank you so much for listening to this conversation with Rick Spence to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description.

And now let me leave you some words from John F Kennedy.

The very word, secrecy, is repugnant in a free and open society, and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, the secret oaths, and the secret proceedings.

We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.

Hey, it''s Jack, host of the show.

When I was a kid, I got an ant farm from my birthday.

It''s like two panes of glass with some sand in between and you can watch the ants dig tunnels and go about their day.

It was really cool, but when you get the ant farm, it doesn''t contain any ants.

You have to order the ants and they''re mailed to you.

And the first thing I thought about when I was a kid and I heard about this was, wait a minute, I can mail ants to anyone I want.

And I think that is basically the hacker mindset to completely ignore some things intended use and find new ways to employ it.

Today we''re going to talk with a hacker who sees the world this way and will hear all the joy and trouble it''s brought him over the years.

These are true stories from the dark side of the internet.

Okay, today we''re gonna have a chat with someone so infamous, he has his own worm named after him, the Sammy worm.

That''s right.

Today we''re talking with Sammy Camcar.

Sammy is a hacker in almost every way.

He does things he''s not supposed to do.

He''s the kind of guy that thinks buttons are toys and you push them for fun just to see what they do, which often ends up breaking something.

I was never malicious person at all.

So all this hacking, all of this exploitation, it''s really about a puzzle.

To me, this was all a puzzle, a really fun puzzle.

There''s a lot of reasons to call Sammy infamous.

But to tell his story, we need to go back to his childhood.

When I was nine years old, my mom bought me my first computer.

So I spent everything she had, so I''d have something to do during the summer.

She knew I lived computers.

I''d always go to the library with her or to her university and go and just spend all day at the library on the computers that they had.

And immediately I went online and I started searching for the ex files, which is obviously the best TV show of the time.

I found some message boards and that quickly became really frustrating to after a refresh and a wait for people to update that message board.

So then I found something called IRC, Internet Relay Chat.

And I jumped on, I went into a channel and said, hey, he wants a chat about the ex files.

and immediately someone told me, get out.

And I''m thinking, that''s weird.

This is like a random person I don''t know on the internet and they''re telling me to do something?

No. So I told the guy, no.

And then he said, you have 10 seconds to get out of this chapter.

And I said, no.

And 10 seconds later, the brand new computer that my mom spent everything on crashes.

I had a blue screen and I freaked out.

I had no idea what to do.

do.

I pulled the power from the back of the computer.

I waited about half an hour for all the bad stuff to get out of the computer.

I think that''s what you''re supposed to do.

And then I plugged it back in.

Unfortunately, it came back up.

Everything was fine.

But really with your adrenaline still rushing through my veins, I was thinking that is the coolest thing ever.

How do I do that?

From that point forward, Sammy was addicted to computers.

This was so fascinating to him.

He wanted to understand how this had been possible.

So he began studying computers and practicing programming.

Since he now had a computer at home, he got into video games too.

Counter-strike was his favorite game.

You know, the first person shooter, he played it a lot.

He was addicted to it.

It was fun.

I mean, it was a ton of fun.

I''ve had a clan and I was playing with a bunch of friends in high school and I remember just one day I was playing and I heard some footsteps.

My computer has two speakers, you know, one on the left side, one on the right side.

So some stereo sound and I hear some footsteps coming from the right speaker and then I hear them panning to the left speaker so that immediately tells me oh there''s someone behind me because I can''t see them in my visual field of view in the game.

So immediately I''m like wait, that means someone is behind me in the game.

This is a live person, someone else on the internet playing Counter Strike with me, but I can''t see them in my radar, which means they''re on the opposing team, so I wondered right then, couldn''t I really use that information, that sound information, on the computer itself?

I''m sure that person killed me pretty quickly, but afterwards I exited Counter Strike, and I started looking into how can I pull that information?

What''s telling the computer to play footsteps on the right speaker, rather than left speaker, because that means there''s positional information there that someone is on the right side versus the left side.

And sure enough, I started learning about packet sniffing and then memory injection and intercepting function calls within the DLLs of CounterStrike itself and intercepting basically everything between the binary, the CounterStrike executable and the DLLs that it used so that I could intercept things like footsteps.

And once I hooked that function, I was then able to get exact coordinates of everyone, because everyone''s footsteps is actually being sent to you.

At least within some range, you will then get that, and that''s just telling your computer where to play the sound.

But that location is exactly where that person''s located.

At that point, I started using OpenGL at the time, and just drawing where the user is on the map in a little heads-up display and a little radar.

And then I started jumping into writing counter-strike cheats software.

That was a lot of fun.

Where were some of the cheats you could do?

Just writing aim bots, so being automatically aiming at people, being able to make any smoke bomb or smoke grenade or flashbang, just make those transparent to me.

So I could go into a room that I knew is full of opposing team members and throw in a flashbang.

And they''re all going to see white for three seconds and I''m going to run in there and see absolutely nothing because I''ve hooked that function and said do nothing.

Just return out.

You know, do a return before you actually do any of the visualization to sort of wipe my screen.

and little things like that became really fun.

I couldn''t actually modify my health that was controlled by this server.

So I couldn''t actually make myself invincible, adding zoom to every weapon.

So weapons that didn''t normally have zoom or might have like a scope on them.

So you lose a lot of the screen because it''s now blacked out.

I would just remove those.

There''s no reason that it''s green to zoom blacked out.

I would remove that.

There''s no reason that zoom should be better in one weapon than not the other.

So I had to zoom to all weapons.

And this is all totally unfair.

and pretty quickly it actually became not fun at all.

Like all of the fun of the game went away entirely because all of a sudden it was practically god mode.

Sammy released the Counter Strike cheats as open source software.

He was beginning to get bored playing the game and then punk buster came out and punk buster is a program that''s designed to scan the memory to see if anyone is cheating in the game and punk buster stopped Sammy from using his cheats.

But now the new game was for Sammy to try to circumvent whatever punk buster was using to detect him.

All of a sudden this game was fun again, because I was no longer playing the game.

I was now playing against these engineers on punk buster.

They were doing their own memory inspection.

They were looking for my process.

They were doing all sorts of things to stop my cheats and other people''s cheats as well.

And that became fun.

At that point I was probably 15 years old.

So it''s so attached to this that I stopped going to high school and I started updating my cheats because this was just so fun and it would be cat and mouse.

So I would release a new version that defeated their software and two days later they would release a new version and then I would have to figure out what do they do, how do they figure it out.

And that was like training.

It was sort of very rapid training in how does at the very least software and networking work.

And I think I probably learned a ton just during that short stint when I was writing this cheats software.

at 16, you dropped out of high school, what did you do after that?

I wasn''t good at school.

I didn''t care about most classes, so I did not do well.

It was not a good learner.

No one ever taught me how to learn something.

I think that was something that I learned later in life.

I just wish there were tools that were taught at school for me.

I think I would have been a much better student.

However, if I''m enjoying something, then I will absolutely learn it.

I''ll spend all my time on it.

I''m still not necessarily a fast learner like I''ve always known that people can pick up stuff much faster than me But if there''s something I enjoy then I''m just gonna spend all my time on it and you know, I''m very persistent Sammy was living at home with his mom in Los Angeles at the time She had recently lost her job and now that she was home more often She noticed Sammy wasn''t going to school and told him if he''s not gonna go to school He needs to get a job to help pay the rent so Sammy started applying for any job he thought he could get.

I got an email out of the blue from a company in San Diego and said, hey, we saw your cheat software, your camera strike stuff.

And will you be willing to contract and just write code for us remotely?

And I was blown away.

I was like, wait, someone will pay me to write code.

Like, I thought this was just useful for basically writing cheat software.

Like, I had no idea that you could use it for other things.

I mean, it was obvious that you could sort of program things, but I just know someone would pay me money to do that.

So I was really, really fortunate in getting that email and I started working with them and just remotely writing code for them and they never met me.

I mean, never even talked on the phone.

It was just all over the email.

And they said, hey, do you want to move to San Diego and work full time with us?

And I said absolutely.

So I took my mom''s car and I just drove down and I met them and I think they were kind of weirded out because they didn''t expect a 15 year old to show up.

and they weren''t even sure if that was legal and I was like oh no don''t worry I looked into it it''s totally legal here''s a work permit that I got from my school which is really just a work permit I had forged and printed out and I just started working with this company down in San Diego and that was really cool and that allowed me to support myself and my mom and she continued to live in LA but I got to start my own life down there which is really great.

That is incredible.

And San Diego, as a teenager, Sammy was working as a programmer, but eventually took on the responsibilities of a systems administrator.

He was making pretty good money for his age, then someone in LA tried to recruit him to work at a startup, and this was the deal, quit your job and come work for us.

Initially, we can''t pay you, but you can have some equity in the company and sleep on a founder''s couch while the startup gets off the ground.

And I said, oh, thanks for that offer now.

Thank you.

And he said, well, what do you want to do with your life?

What do you want to do the next few years?

I thought that was a really good question.

I honestly had not thought about it.

This is not something I normally think about.

And I thought about it for a while.

And I was like, well, I want to learn how to start a company.

I want to learn how to start a successful company that employs people and works on cool projects.

He said, OK, well, I just sold my last company for $30 million cash.

I''ve started multiple companies, I''ve done this before, so why don''t you meet my co-founder and learn with me and you can handle the technical side and Thought about that for a second and it''s like well, I probably won''t get that opportunity ever again So I sort of jumped in and I said, okay, let''s do that We put my job in San Diego came back up to LA slept on his couch and that''s when we started a company called Flanality Finality was creating voice over IP solutions for companies.

Sammy wasn''t getting paid at first.

He had some savings but was blowing through it pretty quick and living as cheap as possible, sleeping on a couch.

But eventually the company started making money, which meant Sammy started getting paid.

Then I think after we were actually making money, because we had become profitable at some point, and then I had a salary and then that salary grew as we came more profitable and didn''t get more rounds and stuff.

So, at some point, I was really fortunate to be able to still support my mom and also have some nice toys.

Things were really looking good for Sammy at this point.

He was 19 years old, making great money at a company that he helped create.

Sammy was a smart young lad, but eventually he got bored.

What do you get when you have a bored hacker?

Yeah, you guessed it.

Trouble.

That''s when I started playing with my space.

My space was the number one site on the internet, and all my friends had, and I sort of held off for a while, and then one day I said, okay, it''s pretty much all my friends have it, so I should just go on there and make an account, see what this is about.

And I made an account, I was like, oh, this is pretty cool, it''s a social network, you can post pictures, and you can post some people''s, I guess you call them profiles back then, and they didn''t have, you wouldn''t call them walls.

If you could have music that auto played, there''s just terrible.

You could do really awful CSS things to your page, but you could also do cool things.

And I really like that.

I actually really appreciate the fact that you could style the page in any way you want it.

You really could beam it and show a little personality.

I thought that was really cool and not something you get to do every day anymore.

So I made a profile, and at this point, pretty technically confident, or I felt that way.

and I thought, well, maybe I can make my profile cooler than some of my friends.

Just more interesting or unique.

So I started saying, all right, well, I could do all the CSS stuff, but how can I really do something interesting?

And I started looking and I think I had gotten like a digital camera and I found that the limitation on the profile pictures was, you can only have some photos.

And I thought it''d be funny just to have a 13th photo.

Like, it''s just a limitation that they had.

No one would really notice, you''d really have to think about it or know this limitation even to realize but I thought that would be sublimating.

funny.

Sammy figured out that the limitation on the number of photos that my space users were allowed to post was set by client side validation.

He realized he could bypass this validation and talk directly to the API server.

And he could submit as many photos as he wanted to my space.

And it worked.

Unbelievable.

So cool.

But now that he had bypassed one validation check, he wondered what What else could he do when you look at a Myspace users profile?

You can see what birthday they have displayed, what their favorite foods are, their music and movies, but there''s also a place to describe your relationship status.

There was a little drop down box.

You could pick single, married, engaged, or in a relationship, but you were bound to only be able to pick one of these that were in the drop down box.

There was no way to enter your own relationship status.

I wanted mine to say in a hot relationship.

That would be funny.

And again, a subtle change.

You couldn''t really do that.

At least back then with that version of CSS.

But I started playing around and said, well, maybe I can execute JavaScript.

Because JavaScript should be able to modify the DOM, modify the page in any way I want.

And I started playing around and found that they pretty much blocked JavaScript in any possible way.

So then I started saying, okay, well, maybe I can mess with the browser.

So I started looking to exploit the browser''s interpretation of tags and found that yes, there''s actually a way that I could execute JavaScript that technically isn''t compliant with say the W3C stack of how HTML should be interpreted, but browsers happen to be pretty lenient and they want web pages to work even if the developer made in there.

So I found a way to execute JavaScript within a CSS tag and then access some data somewhere else on the page and execute JavaScript note.

And this was really cool.

So this allowed me to now change my interrelationship to interrelationship.

Well, another fun and awesome win for Sammy.

At this point, he''s conducted two hacks against Myspace and is looking to see what else he can do.

He realized that when he changed the relationship status, he could get the browser to execute whatever JavaScript he wanted.

But it''s not just that, he could get whoever visited his profile to execute the JavaScript code that he wrote.

To be able to control the browser of whoever visits his page, this was a seriously big deal.

And at that point, it''s like, what else could I do that could be fun?

I started playing around.

I was just doing silly things.

I wanted to see, okay, if someone visited my profile and were not already friends, can I make them at me as a friend?

And I could.

And then I found, well, if I can control their browser, couldn''t I just update their own profile?

And I found, yeah, whenever they visit my profile, I could make them update anything on their profile.

And I didn''t want to be malicious.

I just wanted to do something that I thought was funny.

So I made it so that if you visit my profile, you''d not only would you add me as a friend, but then you would add most of all samis my hero to the bottom of your profile.

I thought that would be kind of funny and after a few days maybe a few of my friends would have it on their profiles and I could just be like hey cool you know point that out to them.

So I release this and a few days go by and nothing really happens like virtually none of my friends have hit it because a lot of people aren''t going to my profile.

So I think okay well how do I make this spread a little faster?

And I''m thinking, all right, if I can make you add me as a friend and add me as a hero to your profile, couldn''t I just copy the code to your profile as well?

So that way, if someone visits that profile, they''ll also add me as a friend, add me as a hero, and then the code will copy to their profile.

So within my friend group, it should probably hit them all within a week or so, and that will be pretty funny.

Someone will complain, and it''ll be taken down, and it''ll be good.

I launch it one night, and I go to sleep, and I wake up hoping to get at least a couple of hits, and unfortunately, I wake up to 10,000 new friends.

10,000 new friends?

Sammy was just trying to have some fun.

He didn''t intend to be malicious, But then it dawned on him.

He''s actually created a virus on my space.

Anyone who visited his profile would immediately add him as a friend.

But then the code to add Sammy as a friend was copied to that person''s profile.

So anyone who visited that person''s profile now had the code to add Sammy as a friend and it just kept spreading.

A virus that spreads itself like this is not just a virus.

It''s a worm.

Sammy has just created a MySpace worm, and it''s spreading way beyond what he thought it would become.

Perhaps he could get a few dozen friends, or even a hundred new friends.

But now he''s got 10,000 new friends, and it''s just constantly going up.

At that point, I just freak out.

I have no idea what to do.

I''m seeing my apartment, and I''m kind of baffled.

So I realized, oops, I just wrote a virus.

And what should I do?

And the problem with the virus is you can''t just remove it like I could remove it from my own profile But that doesn''t mean it''s gonna stop spreading because it''s already spread to thousands of profiles Where you get inflited with messages as well like, you know, you''re just really popular at the same time is having friends People were messaging me they''re like, hey, why are you on my profile?

Hey, every time I try to delete you You come back.

That''s because every time they would delete me from their profile It would return them to their own profile which re-excuted the code which reacted me as a friend So they couldn''t actually delete the virus either themselves, so they really needed my space to do that.

So at that point, I''m like, okay, it''s time for damage control as much as I can do.

So I email my space anonymously.

Hi, I''m a random user of my space.

I have no idea what''s going on.

There''s some weird stuff on my profile.

It looks like a bunch of obfuscated code, and I''m not really sure what it does.

But I think it does detailed explanation of exactly what was going on.

And I think you can fix it by, here''s a detailed explanation of exactly how to fix this problem.

I just prayed that they got it.

Well, I just continued my day.

I mean, at that point, I really couldn''t thank you, so I drove to the office.

In the whole time he''s at work, he''s looking at his Myspace profile and just watching the number of friends he has, rising higher and higher and higher.

150,000, 100,000.

I could not think about anything, I was just refreshing, went home, 500,000, 600,000.

And 600,000 knew my space friends.

Oh, this is going way out of control.

This has to be stopped.

Sammy tried to stop the worm by removing the code on his profile.

I removed the code from my own profile, but that doesn''t do anything, right?

It only removes it so that anyone who is my profile doesn''t get it, but it''s already spreading from anyone else, right?

Once someone else has it, it would just continue to spread.

So there''s no other way to really control it.

Really, my space would have to remember themselves.

Sammy goes off to work, does his shift, comes back home.

600,000, 700,000 it hits a million I just take a screenshot because now I''m just like that''s with a lot of people I had no idea that many people were even on my space.

I just had no idea how big it was I was hoping it would hit a hundred max Over the course of a week or a month or something once it was 10,000 I knew I had done something wrong.

That was I was like, oh, I did not think this through I was just freaked out the entire time.

I was super super concerned because I mean if it hit 10,000 overnight then at that point it was obvious oh yeah it''s just gonna grow ridiculously out of proportion and now I''m refreshing purely because I''m curious how fast it''s spreading so I''m refresh I refresh I refresh and at this point it''s spreading at about 3,000 people per second and as I''m sort of doing this little test of how fast it''s moving I refresh once again and finally my profile has been taken down so I''m pretty happy about this so then I was wondering okay the virus was probably up for about 20 hours.

And I''m thinking, all right, well, does it still say same as my hero and other people''s profiles?

Like, how did they take this down?

So I go to someone else''s profile.

And then I see that that profile is also down like, oh, no.

So I go to myspace.com, just to the website.

And it says, the whole site is down, the whole team is here working on it.

I felt absolutely awful.

I know what it''s like to have servers that are down and I would never want to do that to somebody.

And I''m thinking, okay, the number one site on the internet is down.

And I also recall that MySpace had just been purchased by Fox for half a billion dollars.

And I didn''t really want Fox to come after me.

So I was like, oh no, what do I do?

So I thought about it.

And MySpace is in LA.

So maybe I should just drive over there with some coffee and donuts and be like, hey guys, I''m Sammy.

I''m so sorry.

Can I help do anything?

Can I write some SQL queries?

What can I do?

But I thought that would be a bad idea.

In case they were just really upset, which I would totally understand is where I''d go to jail.

I had no idea what the ramifications of something like this was.

I really had no idea.

Did you tell anyone then?

What did your friends think of this at this point?

Because I mean, the people you work with and stuff, did they know that day?

Like, hey, it''s going crazy.

Your friends, did they know?

And you''re like, hey, and call one of them and say, I think I just took my space down.

I messaged like one or two friends about it.

I should remember explicitly one friend, I messaged just before doing it.

And he''s like, hey, don''t do that.

He was much smarter than I was.

And I think during the thing, I don''t think I''d talk to anyone about it.

My girlfriend, Gred told her, and she thought the whole thing was funny.

And really back then, it was just a social network, it was a small social network, really nothing compared to the networks we have today like Facebook and Twitter.

Granted, it was the largest of the time, but it was 2005, like smartphones had not come out.

There''s a much smaller people in the internet I just didn''t seem as serious.

At this point, my space is down, like the whole website.

Sammy is worried and scared.

The team at my space is probably totally freaking out.

This was the largest social networking site in the world at the time, and it''s down because Sammy decided to have a laugh?

This is not good.

Sammy''s anxiety is growing every minute that the site is down.

He can''t focus on real life right now.

Forget about work, forget about going out with friends.

was what the heck happened to my space?

Was it his worm that took down my space?

How much trouble would he be in if it was?

Hours went by and the site was still down and he was getting more and more anxious as he kept refreshing the page, weeding for it to come back up.

And then hours after the site went down, my space came back online.

Actually, I feel very good that the site is up a few hours later and this way I don''t really know what to do.

like sit around and we''ll start working on other things.

I''m kind of just waiting for the police to come knock on my door.

And a day goes by and a week goes by and I start getting emails from random people on the internet, blog writers and magazines that are like, hey, you know, we heard about the sperm you wrote.

I''m like, I don''t know what you''re talking about.

And they said, is your name Sammy?

I was like, yeah, my name''s Sammy, but you know, I''m not sure what you''re talking about.

And then they sent me a picture and they''re like, is this you?

And it''s my profile picture.

So It was, of course, it''s me and, like, okay, fine.

That was me.

And they started asking, you know, what was this spell?

Like, what was your intention?

This is just a prank on terribly wrong.

They asked, is my state content to you?

And I said, no.

Have the police contacted you?

I say, no.

And a week goes by, two weeks, three months.

Finally, after three months, I''m like, okay.

I''m super fortunate.

No one for my states or police or anything you ever have contacted me.

So, I''m really, really lucky.

I did something pretty dumb.

I''m never doing that again.

And sort of got away, it''s got free.

What a lesson learned, huh?

To accidentally take down the largest social network in the world and not hear from my space or the police, lucky guy.

Because you know what?

Sammy''s fingerprints are all over this worm.

I mean, the worm follows Sammy.

And then the worm actually says, above all, Sammy is my hero.

So it would be really easy for my space to track this back to Sammy, but nothing.

So Sammy just goes back to his regular life, back to his job at finality, which is starting to pay him even more now.

In fact, he was making enough to buy his dream car.

I got a Porsche boxer at the age of 19.

Anyway, he got a brand new car and one day he''s leaving his apartment and he goes down the elevator to the parking garage.

I''m walking down to it, but it''s a brand new car and I see two guys like this standing next to it sitting on it and I''m like oh no I''m getting card jacked and two more guys walk up behind me and then they say Sammy and I was like oh no I realized like card jackers they don''t know your name and they say Sammy we have a search warrant for you this was a surprise six months ago is when he launched a MySpace worm and now they''re coming for him these were representatives from the Secret Services Electronics Crimes Task Force, the LA District Attorney''s Office and the California Highway Patrol.

The highway patrol was there because they had suspicion that Sammy''s fancy new car might have been stolen.

The agents took Sammy into custody and head back up to his apartment.

We all walk up and as we go into my place, there''s a dozen agents already there going through everything.

And what they''re doing is they''re taking everything.

So anything that has data, CD, DVD, my laptop, my computer, my Xbox, and even my iPod was probably worse.

They took my iPod.

All my music was gone.

I loved music, so that was actually somewhat challenging.

Because all my MP3s and any legitimate or illegitimate music I had was gone.

And I was kind of terrified, but also, as someone go with the flow, you know, things happen in life, and you deal with them.

And I''m just waiting for sort of all this to be over, and now I''m reading Search One, because I really want to find out, Like, is this about my space?

Is this about something else?

Is this about some computers I hacked into?

I have no idea.

And I''m reading through, reading through, and then finally I see the words myspace.com.

Okay, good.

So it''s about that.

At least that one was a prank.

Then I''m reading, reading, reading, and then I see another address that they''re allowed to search.

And it''s my office.

So I asked them, are you guys gonna search my office?

They''re like, we''re already there.

One of the ages asked me, what''s that on your counter?

So in my living room, there was a table and it had some equipment on it, some smart card reader writer stuff and some smart cards stuff.

And it''s like, what are you doing with that?

And at this point, I think, okay, the Secret Service agent just asked me what these smart cards are.

And in my head, I''m like, should I tell them or should I lie about what this is?

And my friend was staying at my apartment for work at my company.

And I was showing him that I had to hack the laundry machines in our apartment building so that I could get free laundry.

And I was basically cloning smart cards or like replaying the information from a smart card to make it appear that it had more money than it did and I decided I should not lie to these people so I just told them that and fortunately they only just laughed and that''s nothing else came of that afterwards they collected everything and then they walked out and I''m like hey guys like are you taking me with you and they said no no you''re not under arrest at least for now and I said oh okay and they walked away and all of a sudden I just had no computers.

I went to the office.

Unfortunately, somehow the CEO was able to convince them that I was like an intern and that I had no access to anything, because when they came in, they said, hey, what to say?

I mean, can''t we have access to it?

The CEO was like, well, everything.

And they''re like, all right, guys, take everything.

This is a cloud-based company.

So when you take everything back then, we ran all the servers.

So they were about to take all of our servers, which would just bankrupt us instantly.

Fortunately, he convinced them something else that I was an intern or something weird, and they only took my stuff, just my computer, my phone.

And at that point, I got an attorney, and we ended up basically fighting with the LADA for about six months.

The Los Angeles DA charged Sammy with modifying data on a remote machine.

In settlement talks, prosecutors proposed that Sammy served some time in prison and not be able to use his computer for the rest of his life.

Keep in mind that Sammy was supporting his mother, and as a high school dropout, his only skill set in his livelihood We''re entirely dependent on using a computer.

Semi was so bright and gifted and passionate about computers and technology on the internet and hacking.

You can imagine how scary it was for him to face the prospect of having to live the rest of his life without ever being able to use a computer again.

Probably the hardest part, really the hardest part of anything I think, at least for me, is not knowing what an outcome will be.

I think it''s much easier to deal with, maybe even the most challenging outcome.

If I know that''s going to happen, you just tell me, okay, I''m going to go to the prison for the rest of my life, then I can at least mentally try to prepare for that.

But not knowing was just really difficult to deal with.

But ultimately, I took a plea agreement with them.

And the plea agreement was no prison time, so that was nice.

However, I would not be able to touch a computer for the rest of my life.

That was still in there.

And probation indefinitely, I would have to pay some restitution, I''d have to do a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

In fact, it also explicitly stated I could not access MySpace.com', '2024-10-31 05:23:58', '2024-10-31 05:23:58');

' a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

In fact, it also explicitly stated I could not access MySpace.com, so in case I somehow was able to access it without the internet of our computer.

So that was it.

Sammy had lost everything.

I mean, forget about the Porsche at this point, because on top of all this, they gave him a $20,000 fine.

So between having to pay all the lawyers and the fine and still having to support his mom, yeah, he was almost completely wiped out, almost back to zero, living as cheap as possible.

But still, forget all that.

I don''t think Sammy carried about the money at this point.

He was back to trying to figure out what he should do with his entire life.

No internet for life?

Everything he''s been working towards, all his skills and knowledge are useless now.

Sammy had 720 hours of community service he had to complete.

So every Saturday morning, he''d get up at 5 a.m. and go clean trash on the side of the highway for years.

Even if he did six hours every Saturday, that''s still just 300 hours a year, so everything about Sammy''s life was changed.

And he had to find new things to do that didn''t involve a computer to keep himself busy.

But I was really fortunate.

I mean, I met new people, I spent all that time just sort of doing other things that I had never really spent time doing.

I went outside, I saw the sun was like, ah, it''s so bright, but I got used to it.

that I made friends, I turned 21, so I get started going out meeting people, started learning to socialize a lot more.

So it''s really, really beneficial to me and something I wouldn''t really change today learned so much from that experience.

And I think it was good for someone so introverted and so stuck to a computer to be able to go out and experience other things.

So Sammy spent years of his life offline, doing his community service and trying to socialize with his friends.

But the story doesn''t end here.

After the break, Sammy gets to use computers again.

This episode is sponsored by Grammarly.

It''s pretty daunting.

Starting the work day and seeing unread messages here, unread emails there, and some documents you''ve got to go over and edit.

10 minutes in and you''re already drowning in the tabs you have open.

I find the key to managing multiple tasks is to focus on finishing each task one by one.

After two years of probation, Sammy has served all 720 hours of his community service.

He had great behavior.

The probation officer didn''t find anything wrong that Sammy did.

And since he had such great behavior, they went back to court to see if he could get the probation lifted.

And after a few years, I went back to court, and today, you know, my probation officer loves me.

It says I''m our favorite client, and they said, okay, you are a lot of touch computers again.

That was a very interesting experience.

I felt really weird touching the computer afterwards.

We kind of just get used to the rules that you''re abiding by, and it''s definitely an awkward feeling jumping back in.

What happens on that day that you got it back?

I definitely remember that day because I drove to the LA Courthouse and after I left the courthouse, I drove to the office store and found whatever the latest, you know, top of the line.

I don''t even think it was a MacBook.

It might have been a power book at that time.

I bought the top of the line power book and I went to a coffee shop.

I pulled it open and I connected to the Wi-Fi and I visited a couple of websites, so I think I visited the flash drive just to see what''s going on.

And I just felt really weird and I just shut the laptop and I went to go hang out with friends.

This started the next chapter in Sammy''s life.

Now that he was free to use the computer again, he eventually got back into it, way into it.

Even though he hadn''t been allowed to use a computer for the last two years, he had spent that time thinking of all sorts of things he can do with them.

During that time that I had no internet, I had no computers.

I started thinking about new exploits, new ways to really manipulate more systems and like exploit routers and exploit firewalls and just had some concepts literally just in my head and I couldn''t confirm whether they were accurate or not, whether they would work after I came back online.

And I started thinking, well, this stuff is fun.

Like maybe I can do this stuff, but not impact websites, not impact people negatively.

So how can I investigate the technology around us, look for the vulnerabilities around us and then share that information publicly in an entirely legal way so people actually understand the problems and can use solutions.

So just six months after Sammy had completed his probation for hacking my space, as 2008, Sammy was around 21 years old and starts looking into hacking credit cards, specifically the NFC and RFID chips on them.

Yeah, some other researchers and myself, we''re looking at these NFC credit cards which are becoming a lot more ubiquitous today but back then it was fun kind of funny they actually came out with these credit cards with NFC and pretty quickly they were encrypted somewhere encrypted however you could actually just buy a chip with the decryption key so you would just buy a chip from a company and you could then decrypt anyone''s credit card access their credit card info and then literally steal stuff with it and that was not my intention But I want to show that this stuff is not secure, so I just created a proof of concept that opened up this to some additional credit cards And there were some other tools that did similar things for other types of credit cards And I know mine was like a visa chase card that no one hadn''t done this for yet How close to someone do you have to be to get their credit card details?

Like does it work from far away?

I haven''t really experimented with how far you can do it So I''m not sure you do need to be close to them It''s very easy to be within proximity of many many people you just go to a crowded place and now you can see all many, many credit cards and then you can go home and buy a ton of stuff online or you can sell those credit cards online and really just steal money.

Even just bumping up against someone in the line, if they have an NFC or RFID vulnerable credit card in their pocket, that would be good enough to steal their credit card, right?

That''s correct.

That''s such a trip.

You know what''s funny is after releasing that and demonstrating that NFC then disappeared from our credit cards and it only recently re-emerged in the past few years and now with much stronger cryptography and additional safeguards from these sorts of tax.

However, there are other attacks.

I mean, it will always be cat and mouse right now.

Nothing is ever perfectly secure and to be fair, it''s much easier to be the attacker.

Well, Sammy studied how to hack the chips within credit cards.

He never did anything malicious with this.

He never actually stole anyone''s credit cards that he didn''t have permission to steal.

Instead, he started blogging about this and teaching others about the safety involved with these products in an attempt to make them more secure.

And from then on, Sammy would continue to research the security of so many more things, but always in an ethical and safe way.

He would do this on his own equipment and disclose what he found to vendors.

For instance, Sammy recently released a proof of concept to show how you can steal passwords and encryption keys by just listening.

This sort of stuff has been done for years by other people, by researchers, and I''m just trying to see can I do this on a two dollar chip or an Arduino that many people know how to use and many makers can just buy off the shelf and then they perform these types of attacks.

There''s a tax out there where researchers have demonstrated just taking a phone, a regular phone, putting it near a computer, and when a computer is doing some sort of cryptographic operation and maybe it''s encrypting an email, maybe it''s trying to send some Bitcoin, maybe it''s doing a financial transaction, maybe it''s logging into a bank.

When any of these things are being done and the processor is like processing those instructions in a certain order, Well, the processor requires power and different instructions require different amounts of power.

So, addition will be less power than a multiplication, which is really just a bunch of additions.

And you can then measure that power, but if you have a phone, you can use the microphone.

So, let''s say I''ve put a phone next to someone''s laptop and they''re encrypting an email with like the secret key.

Well, when that CPU is pulling power from all these capacitors, those capacitors are going through this thing called electro-strictive effect and they''re physically moving inside your computer and they''re moving at a speed, a rate against the circuit board inside that produces ultrasound.

You and I can''t hear ultrasound, but the phones that we have, the mobile devices we have, those microphones actually can listen all the way into the ultrasound range.

And if you have, say, an Android device with a microphone enabled and it listens to that ultrasound, you can then look at that sound, that amplitude or the volume of the sound, And then correlated and say, well, the higher the sound, the more power those capacitors are using and feeding to the CPU.

And if I know it''s this much power for this long, well, I can do timing and power analysis and say, well, that means you''re doing an addition here or you''re probably doing a jump or a branch here or a comparison here.

And this looks like you''re doing an AES encryption at 128 bit key.

And, you know, if you''re encrypting with a zero bit or so one bit, that''s going to take different instructions with different amount of power.

and then I can fully recover that key.

It''s pretty impressive.

And these are the types of attacks that are really explaining physical phenomena, right?

Things that a software developer might implement something perfectly, but there''s still these other attacks.

Sammy continued finding new areas to do security research in.

And at some point, he got interested in cookies.

Cookies are what web browsers use to remember who you are.

So when you return to a website, they can log you in or show you content that''s just for you.

So cookies are a tracking mechanism, and browser store these cookies on the user''s computer.

In a very specific location, but as Sammy looked into it, he was noticing some websites figured out a way to track users without storing the cookie in that traditional location.

For instance, some sites ran Flash to display fancy graphics.

Well, when you get to that website, the Flash video is downloaded and stored on your computer, and the next time you go to that website, your browser checks to see if you already have that video or if you need to download it.

But people were really concerned because some researchers found that some companies were using flash to store cookies on people''s computers.

And the benefit of this was that if a user deletes their normal cookies, their normal web browser or cookies, which is what advertisers used to track you, well, then the flash cookie was essentially acting as a backup, right?

And really serotoniously, because they obviously did that intentionally because they knew users might delete their omics.

And I was thinking, well, the browser was a pretty powerful piece of software until a lot of things.

I wonder what other mechanisms where I could actually store information locally.

And again, this is sort of a proof of concept to demonstrate what are all the ways that we can store information on a person''s computer whether they know it or not.

So I created this open source JavaScript library called EverCookie and it used normal cookies.

So it essentially generated random ID to track somebody.

And then you store it in their normal cookies, you store it in flash cookies.

But then I tried to find every possible other mechanism that you could use locally.

So there were silver lights.

So you silver light storage and then Java and HTML5 came out.

So then there was local storage and session storage, global storage, SQL light, local cache, your web history.

My friend Matt came up with a really cool idea of just storing the data in an image that would get cached.

And then you could actually read out the pixels of an image and then converted it back to an ID, all sorts of stuff.

And that was people like Matt and other people also started contributing to this project as it''s an entirely open source project on GitHub that that anyone can actually contribute to.

This ever cookie project that Sammy made really demonstrated how easy it is for websites to track their users even if they delete their cookies.

And this was a really effective technique.

So effective that when Snowden released a bunch of classified documents about what the NSA is doing, in there it even said that the NSA sometimes uses ever cookie to track its users through tour.

A couple people pointed out to me over the years that different governments have been using ever cookie to try to track people.

And it definitely feels good that a lot of governments are using my software, granted they''re doing it for a reason that I''m not into.

But I actually think the net gain of the entire project is extremely positive because whatever cookie really provided and still provides today is an asset test.

So now browsers essentially can use ever cookie to see, okay, does my private mode, does my incognito mode, does that provide the necessary protection to make get challenging to track this user, at least using local storage mechanisms.

And before ever cookie, there was nothing like that.

So no one knew about many of these techniques, and it''s very trivial for any company or government to then generate their own techniques.

But by consolidating it into a very simple to use the library, and always trying to keep it up to date, you know, people today are still updating ever cookie with new techniques.

Modern browsers that want to provide consumers and users and businesses privacy, it gives in that capability, because they know, okay, I''ve tested it at least against Evercooki, which is sort of state of the art and local storage mechanisms, and Evercooki can''t track it, so at least it makes it very difficult.

So governments who are using it, they''re really only able to track all browser users who don''t upgrade their browsers to operating systems.

Where people who actually do care about their privacy, those people typically know to use modern up-to-date software.

So I think the overall net gain is extremely beneficial.

Let''s talk about Skyjack then, because I think this is a really cool project.

What is Skyjack?

Skyjack started when I started hearing that Amazon was potentially going to use drones to deliver packages.

And I thought that was really cool, I mean, I think it''s really awesome that we have drones.

I think drones are super interesting, they''re low cost, and they''ll probably enable a lot of really useful things for humans.

However, I was somewhat concerned that that was the idea.

was like delivering just packages because I don''t really know if there''s any security on drones.

So I wasn''t sure I really didn''t know anything about drones so I went out and I bought the most ubiquitous consumer drone and then soon after I also bought industrial drones, type of drones that police use.

And immediately I started looking to see what are the protection mechanisms at least in the consumer drone and immediately I found absolutely zero.

Literally none.

You know one drone was using essentially Wi-Fi to be controlled and you could hijack that connection.

You could only have one person controlling the drone at a time, so if I would just essentially kick that person off and then I would take over and then I would modify the drone software so that the person could never log back in and then I would have full control and I found that I could do that and then I started looking at more industrial drones and found that they did have encryption.

However, that encryption was not good at all.

Basically, if you sat on a radio frequency channel, essentially it''s doing frequency hopping, So the transmitter is jumping around to different frequencies for various reasons, partially security, partially to prevent jamming or if there''s a lot of interference that interference will disappear after it hops to the next frequency.

But that was also based off the encryption key.

I found a packet sit on a single frequency and I see two packets come in from that drone, essentially it would have hopped hundreds of times.

And then I jump onto another frequency and I see it hopped on that frequency two times.

all of that would typically take a couple seconds tops.

I would then be able to reverse the key within a second.

I would be able to understand what the encryption key is and then I would be able to hop along and take over that drone as well.

So at that point I put all of this into an open source project called Skyjack.

I put on GitHub and I took a Raspberry Pi Linux computer.

I put my software on it.

I added some Wi-Fi transceivers and some sub-gigaheads transceivers for the industrial drones and you would then attach this Raspberry Pi to your own drone, and you''d fly your own drone around, and while you''re flying your drone around, Skyjack ever saw another drone on any of these wireless frequencies or within wireless range, it would then hijack and take over that drone, and you would now be in control of both drones.

In fact, any wireless drones found in the vicinity, you would take over all of them, and you''d be controlling a swarm of zombie drones entirely under your control from one transmitter.

And that was sort of the proof of concept there, and it was a really fun project, especially fun to be testing it.

Of course, I was testing only on my own drones that I owned, but it of course affected pretty much all models of old major drones at time.

No, I''ve flown a drone.

And one of those scariest feelings I''ve ever had is when you lose control of the thing and it just starts doing its own thing for whatever reason, right?

I mean, that''s a little bit evil what you''re doing here.

I''m not taking over anyone''s else''s drone.

I''ve only taken over my own.

Okay.

But giving the world the ability to do it, I don''t know.

I would disagree with that statement because the world has always had that capability of doing it, right?

How do you know people other people aren''t doing it already?

I would actually suspect that there are plenty of organizations who are doing it.

They''re just not going to tell you about it, right?

They''re not going to put it on the internet.

They''re not going to put it on GitHub and let you know that they''re taking over people''s drones or that they''ve developed the software and hardware necessary to do it.

They''re just going to create that and they''re going to stockpile it so that they can use it against people or companies or governments at their will.

That''s what we found when the NSA say leaks came out, we found out that they were stockpiling all of these vulnerabilities, including major, major vulnerabilities that affected many even the NSA that wants to protect America, knows that everyone''s running, say Windows computer, many people are running Windows computers, and they stockpiled Windows vulnerability zero days that nobody knew about.

It was only when one of these databases from the NSA was bleak that criminals were then able to use those exploits and actually attack many, many millions of computers around the internet, Americans and non-Americans, I don''t think it matters where you''re from.

So what I''m doing by releasing this stuff is demonstrating that, yes, this is the issue and you can patch it.

If I don''t release it, then the issue will continue to exist.

You might ask, well, why don''t I just directly communicate with the companies?

Often I do.

And I found over time that when you communicate directly with companies, they typically don''t resolve these sorts of things.

Unless you''re talking maybe existing, you know, specific software vulnerabilities in their architecture.

But if you''re saying, hey, you''re not using encryption or using like really wrong or it''s really the underlying protocol that is the issue.

I found that that''s when people don''t actually resolve anything.

And that''s when I started releasing stuff publicly and finding, oh, if you release a cool proof of concept that demonstrates the real problem, the underlying core problem, even if it''s not necessarily an issue with maybe the manufacturer, but rather a problem with the underlying protocol and just assumptions that were made, there is enough public pressure that causes that company to then resolve that issue due to the public pressure, not due to the vulnerability itself.

Because that''s often what companies are trying to do and no fault to them.

They''re trying to do what their customers want, right?

They''re trying to do what might move the needle for them.

And I found that this is an effective and appropriate way I believe to move the needle in a direction that I believe will help many people overall rather than just manufacture a company or a specific organization.

Has any company gotten upset with you and tried to come after you for some reason of disclosing vulnerabilities in their system publicly?

I''ve gotten seasoned assists many times, and it''s extremely fortunate that the EFF electronic frontier foundation, they have actually been very helpful to me, and they''re a nonprofit of attorneys who are really just looking for consumers and digital rights.

So your ability to have free speech online, your ability to inspect the software and hardware you use, the ability to own the things that you purchase.

I mean, there are companies who are trying to take this away from us.

But the EFF, I mean, really fortunate where they''ve defended me in some of these regards.

And so I''ve never had to succumb to and actually agree to assist to this day.

For the last decade, Sammy has continued to take on very interesting projects, hacking into stuff and exposing vulnerabilities.

Like another thing he found was that smartphones were tracking their users without their knowledge, which was a revelation that led to a class action lawsuit.

This all started because I was looking at I think a beta version of Firefox at the time.

And I was looking at the release notes and it talked about geolocation and I said cool that''s interesting like I''ve always been interested in location like being able to locate where someone is whether it''s on their cell phone or their computer or laptop or whatever.

And you know there''s always been these geo IP databases that sort of give you geography but really they''re or maybe accurate to the city, but often not.

And even city accuracy is not that great.

So I saw this thing about HTML5 geolocation and a Firefox data, and I started investigating, I wrote some code according to API of how it worked.

I ran it and all of a sudden, my browsers showed me exactly where I was.

Like literally, it showed me the physical address of my home.

And I was like, that''s absolutely crazy.

I''m on a laptop and my laptop does not have GPS.

I know that for a fact.

So how does it know where I am?

And I started sniffing the packets to see where it was going.

I mean, granted, you could just look at the source code.

It''s Firefox, so it''s open source.

And after sniffing, and I think maybe intercepting the TLS, I saw that it''s taking all of the wireless MAC address, all of the unique MAC addresses, all the routers around you, NAPs, and sending that to Google.

So even if your wireless routers are encrypted, and even if you don''t have one, and there are other people who have them, even if they''re encrypted, the MAC address is a unique identifier that isn''t unencrypted.

and your computer sends all of those to Google.

And Google returns the exact location that you''re located.

And you''re also sending only the wireless routers but the signal strength of each of them.

So then they can actually perform what''s called trilaterations, like triangulation, but essentially they use that signal strength and then really accurate this term where you are.

And I''m like, this is absolutely crazy.

How are they figuring all this out?

And I found that you''re basically sending all of these unique Mac addresses of all these routers around you and Google would send back.

your exact location.

So then I''m wondering, well, how does Google know where all these routers are?

And I thought about it some and I thought about some more and then I was, oh, there''s these Google Street View cars and these Google Street View cars are driving around and they have cameras on them and that''s where you get Street View from, right?

That really helpful feature of Google Maps where you can see like a Street View.

And I realized that they must have computers and like Wi-Fi systems on there that are also monitoring for these Wi-Fi Mac addresses and then correlating it with the GPS of the Street View Car and then uploading it all to Google and that''s how they''re getting this information.

It''s like that''s really clever.

And I started doing talks about this because I then found a way that I could essentially abuse that API and use it for myself whenever someone visit my website and I could see exactly where they were and I could even show them.

You''d come to my website, without your authorization, I could then send your Mac address and find where you are.

And I was talking about this in broader Slava and Slovakia and afterward someone said, say I mean, it''s interesting, but fortunately, you know, this does not apply to us because Google Street View cars are not allowed here.

Interesting.

So I''ll just give it a shot and try to running it, just confirm.

And oddly enough, it still worked.

It actually worked very accurately.

And it''s like, wait a second.

I don''t think Google''s lying.

I don''t believe that they are doing something illegal.

I don''t think they have Street View cars when they say they''re not doing that.

And you would notice, I mean, those cars stick out with with these massive sensors on top of them.

So what else might Google have access to, especially in somewhere random like Bratislava?

And I thought a little bit more and then realized, oh wait, Android phones.

There are Android phones everywhere.

And I wonder if these Android phones are actually we''re driving machines.

And after the reverse engineering, some binary blobs on Android devices, this was not actually in the source code that I could find.

I found these binaries that were essentially grabbing all Wi-Fi Mac addresses, is sending the signal strength of all these wireless routers up to Google along with GPS coordinates.

So essentially every Android phone in existence is a war driving machine for Google.

That''s grabbing all this information, grabbing all this location data.

So even if you don''t use an Android phone, other Android phones near you are then taking your routers information and sending it up with the location.

Sammy also figured out that iPhones were doing the same thing, but sending the data to Apple instead of Google.

And what''s worse is that in some cases, this was happening even after users turned off the location services or GPS.

Well, this was encrypted, so it took a little time to really understand what was going on in reverse engineering stuff.

And to really just demonstrate this as a fun proof of concept, I created a tool, really just a simple mobile app that behaved just like Google Maps.

And I found that Google was actually doing something really clever with their information, not only were they collecting where everyone was at all times via Android devices, but that''s also how they collect traffic.

So that''s how you know whether a street is green, yellow, or red, and whether there''s traffic or not in Google Maps is because all of the phones are constantly delivering their GPS location.

And if you time that, if you say, all right, I''m here now and in 10 seconds I''m here, well, you can calculate the distance they traveled over that time and know how fast they''re moving.

So that''s how they get Google Maps traffic.

So Sam, he thought about this for a minute and realized if the Android phones are the ones that are delivering data to Google and giving the traffic updates for the Google Maps, could he somehow exploit that?

Could he somehow trick Google servers into thinking there''s a traffic jam when there''s really not?

I created a app that was just like Google Maps and you''d start from point A and say, I''m at this location and I want to drive to wherever to West Hollywood.

And it would give you turn-by-turn directions.

But on those turn-by-turn directions of my route, it would sound only tangibly pretend to be thousands and thousands of other Android devices.

And all those devices, all those fake devices, would send up information to Google saying, hey, I''m one of these Android devices, and I''m moving zero miles per hour.

So all of a sudden, my route, the route that my app gave me, would turn red and black for everyone else, and they would get diverted to different routes on Google Maps.

And hopefully, my route would be a little bit faster as there would be less cars on the road.

And that was sort of my proof and concept to demonstrating this sort of this issue.

And I''ve some of this could even continue even when you turned off these features, like, location.

I love this hack.

To make it so wherever you drive, Google traffic is diverting drivers to go away from you because it''s congested wherever you are.

Even though it''s not congested where you are, you''re just sending fake data to Google.

It''s just brilliant.

Yeah, you know, it''s the proof of concept just to poke fun at the information and kind of just demonstrate like what this information is capable of doing.

While this is cool, the underlying issue here is that users were unknowingly sending their exact location to Google.

And I don''t know about you, but I don''t personally like that Google knows exactly where my phone is at all times.

I just think it''s a violation of privacy of some sort.

And you know what?

I''m not the only one who thinks that.

Yeah, so ultimately, you know, the biggest issue was that people weren''t accepting that A, they were sending all this data up.

So ultimately, Google and Apple had to appear on Capitol Hill because they previously said, no, we''re not tracking you.

And, you know, this research demonstrated that, yes, in fact, they were tracking exactly where you are virtually at all times.

And in some cases, it begins to your consent when you turned off location services on Apple.

Again, those devices were still sending information that allowed full location of where you were because it was sending Mac addresses, which they already knew where those were.

So it''s simply one step correlation in a database they already have.

So that''s not really fair to say that they''re not grabbing that information.

And ultimately, you know, they did resolve these things.

You know, it''s funny that the same thing is still happening, right?

All these phones are still doing the same things.

The only difference is now you click OK when they say they do it.

But the benefit here is that for people who don''t want this sort of technology to run, they can say no on their phone.

The scary thing, though, is that even if you don''t even have one of these phones, it''s all the phones around that are still collecting that information of your router, of the devices on your network, even though it''s somebody else''s device.

I saw a video the other day about a guy who put like a hundred Android cell phones all in a wagon and slowly walked down the road, and this triggered the Google location API thing to make it show that the road was really congested and made it turn red as well.

So it looks like this API is still under attack just by researchers and people doing weird stunts and stuff So yeah, Sammy has a pretty cool YouTube channel.

You should check that out And he''s also given a lot of talks at various conferences like she''s all over the world How many talks have you given at this point Sammy?

I don''t know maybe 50 or so Where are you working now and after all days?

I mean this is just such a whirlwind life you''ve had so far I''ve started a company called Open Path with some friends, and we''ve been growing quite a bit.

I''ve done some research in RFID and cloning badges, and being able to demonstrate how to break into buildings.

Many years ago, we found that technology has not changed in the 10 years since I''ve looked.

You know, wrote software that was able to clone badges and break into various levels of security for physical access for buildings.

And we were sitting around and thinking, well, you know, why is this still a problem?

And it''s still inconvenient.

Like, why do I have to carry around this thick card in my wallet?

like I''m trying to get rid of my wallet.

And we ended up building this business called Open Path where you could essentially have physical access control for businesses and buildings where, hey, you don''t need a card.

You could use a card if you wanted, but you could just use your phone.

Your phone actually has really strong encryption.

We have things like TLS, we have AES, we have open encryption standards that people have been trying to break for many, many years and haven''t that are entirely open and can be inspected by anyone.

So we''re using those technologies to essentially unlock doors and you don''t even need to pull your phone out.

You literally just get within Bluetooth range of one of these devices, then you can walk right in as long as you have authorization.

So we''re trying to really make a really modern and cloud-based and secure way of getting into buildings that is just really convenient because I''m just trying to get rid of the things in my wallet and this kind of technology is just really interesting.

Yes, that technology is interesting, but so much technology is interesting.

And we live in a time where technology is in abundance all around us.

And if you think about technology as much as Sammy does, it''s like a playground for him.

To be able to tinker with it all and take it apart and put it back together in ways it was never intended, Sammy''s hacker mindset is still going strong today and it will probably be strong for decades more to come, provided he doesn''t accidentally launch another warm and take down the largest social networking website once again.

A big thank you to Sammy Camcart for coming on and telling us all this.

Hey, it''s Jack, host of the show.

When I was a kid, I got an ant farm from my birthday.

It''s like two panes of glass with some sand in between and you can watch the ants dig tunnels and go about their day.

It was really cool, but when you get the ant farm, it doesn''t contain any ants.

You have to order the ants and they''re mailed to you.

And the first thing I thought about when I was a kid and I heard about this was, wait a minute, I can mail ants to anyone I want.

And I think that is basically the hacker mindset to completely ignore some things intended use and find new ways to employ it.

Today we''re going to talk with a hacker who sees the world this way and will hear all the joy and trouble it''s brought him over the years.

These are true stories from the dark side of the internet.

Okay, today we''re gonna have a chat with someone so infamous, he has his own worm named after him, the Sammy worm.

That''s right.

Today we''re talking with Sammy Camcar.

Sammy is a hacker in almost every way.

He does things he''s not supposed to do.

He''s the kind of guy that thinks buttons are toys and you push them for fun just to see what they do, which often ends up breaking something.

I was never malicious person at all.

So all this hacking, all of this exploitation, it''s really about a puzzle.

To me, this was all a puzzle, a really fun puzzle.

There''s a lot of reasons to call Sammy infamous.

But to tell his story, we need to go back to his childhood.

When I was nine years old, my mom bought me my first computer.

So I spent everything she had, so I''d have something to do during the summer.

She knew I lived computers.

I''d always go to the library with her or to her university and go and just spend all day at the library on the computers that they had.

And immediately I went online and I started searching for the ex files, which is obviously the best TV show of the time.

I found some message boards and that quickly became really frustrating to after a refresh and a wait for people to update that message board.

So then I found something called IRC, Internet Relay Chat.

And I jumped on, I went into a channel and said, hey, he wants a chat about the ex files.

and immediately someone told me, get out.

And I''m thinking, that''s weird.

This is like a random person I don''t know on the internet and they''re telling me to do something?

No. So I told the guy, no.

And then he said, you have 10 seconds to get out of this chapter.

And I said, no.

And 10 seconds later, the brand new computer that my mom spent everything on crashes.

I had a blue screen and I freaked out.

I had no idea what to do.

do.

I pulled the power from the back of the computer.

I waited about half an hour for all the bad stuff to get out of the computer.

I think that''s what you''re supposed to do.

And then I plugged it back in.

Unfortunately, it came back up.

Everything was fine.

But really with your adrenaline still rushing through my veins, I was thinking that is the coolest thing ever.

How do I do that?

From that point forward, Sammy was addicted to computers.

This was so fascinating to him.

He wanted to understand how this had been possible.

So he began studying computers and practicing programming.

Since he now had a computer at home, he got into video games too.

Counter-strike was his favorite game.

You know, the first person shooter, he played it a lot.

He was addicted to it.

It was fun.

I mean, it was a ton of fun.

I''ve had a clan and I was playing with a bunch of friends in high school and I remember just one day I was playing and I heard some footsteps.

My computer has two speakers, you know, one on the left side, one on the right side.

So some stereo sound and I hear some footsteps coming from the right speaker and then I hear them panning to the left speaker so that immediately tells me oh there''s someone behind me because I can''t see them in my visual field of view in the game.

So immediately I''m like wait, that means someone is behind me in the game.

This is a live person, someone else on the internet playing Counter Strike with me, but I can''t see them in my radar, which means they''re on the opposing team, so I wondered right then, couldn''t I really use that information, that sound information, on the computer itself?

I''m sure that person killed me pretty quickly, but afterwards I exited Counter Strike, and I started looking into how can I pull that information?

What''s telling the computer to play footsteps on the right speaker, rather than left speaker, because that means there''s positional information there that someone is on the right side versus the left side.

And sure enough, I started learning about packet sniffing and then memory injection and intercepting function calls within the DLLs of CounterStrike itself and intercepting basically everything between the binary, the CounterStrike executable and the DLLs that it used so that I could intercept things like footsteps.

And once I hooked that function, I was then able to get exact coordinates of everyone, because everyone''s footsteps is actually being sent to you.

At least within some range, you will then get that, and that''s just telling your computer where to play the sound.

But that location is exactly where that person''s located.

At that point, I started using OpenGL at the time, and just drawing where the user is on the map in a little heads-up display and a little radar.

And then I started jumping into writing counter-strike cheats software.

That was a lot of fun.

Where were some of the cheats you could do?

Just writing aim bots, so being automatically aiming at people, being able to make any smoke bomb or smoke grenade or flashbang, just make those transparent to me.

So I could go into a room that I knew is full of opposing team members and throw in a flashbang.

And they''re all going to see white for three seconds and I''m going to run in there and see absolutely nothing because I''ve hooked that function and said do nothing.

Just return out.

You know, do a return before you actually do any of the visualization to sort of wipe my screen.

and little things like that became really fun.

I couldn''t actually modify my health that was controlled by this server.

So I couldn''t actually make myself invincible, adding zoom to every weapon.

So weapons that didn''t normally have zoom or might have like a scope on them.

So you lose a lot of the screen because it''s now blacked out.

I would just remove those.

There''s no reason that it''s green to zoom blacked out.

I would remove that.

There''s no reason that zoom should be better in one weapon than not the other.

So I had to zoom to all weapons.

And this is all totally unfair.

and pretty quickly it actually became not fun at all.

Like all of the fun of the game went away entirely because all of a sudden it was practically god mode.

Sammy released the Counter Strike cheats as open source software.

He was beginning to get bored playing the game and then punk buster came out and punk buster is a program that''s designed to scan the memory to see if anyone is cheating in the game and punk buster stopped Sammy from using his cheats.

But now the new game was for Sammy to try to circumvent whatever punk buster was using to detect him.

All of a sudden this game was fun again, because I was no longer playing the game.

I was now playing against these engineers on punk buster.

They were doing their own memory inspection.

They were looking for my process.

They were doing all sorts of things to stop my cheats and other people''s cheats as well.

And that became fun.

At that point I was probably 15 years old.

So it''s so attached to this that I stopped going to high school and I started updating my cheats because this was just so fun and it would be cat and mouse.

So I would release a new version that defeated their software and two days later they would release a new version and then I would have to figure out what do they do, how do they figure it out.

And that was like training.

It was sort of very rapid training in how does at the very least software and networking work.

And I think I probably learned a ton just during that short stint when I was writing this cheats software.

at 16, you dropped out of high school, what did you do after that?

I wasn''t good at school.

I didn''t care about most classes, so I did not do well.

It was not a good learner.

No one ever taught me how to learn something.

I think that was something that I learned later in life.

I just wish there were tools that were taught at school for me.

I think I would have been a much better student.

However, if I''m enjoying something, then I will absolutely learn it.

I''ll spend all my time on it.

I''m still not necessarily a fast learner like I''ve always known that people can pick up stuff much faster than me But if there''s something I enjoy then I''m just gonna spend all my time on it and you know, I''m very persistent Sammy was living at home with his mom in Los Angeles at the time She had recently lost her job and now that she was home more often She noticed Sammy wasn''t going to school and told him if he''s not gonna go to school He needs to get a job to help pay the rent so Sammy started applying for any job he thought he could get.

I got an email out of the blue from a company in San Diego and said, hey, we saw your cheat software, your camera strike stuff.

And will you be willing to contract and just write code for us remotely?

And I was blown away.

I was like, wait, someone will pay me to write code.

Like, I thought this was just useful for basically writing cheat software.

Like, I had no idea that you could use it for other things.

I mean, it was obvious that you could sort of program things, but I just know someone would pay me money to do that.

So I was really, really fortunate in getting that email and I started working with them and just remotely writing code for them and they never met me.

I mean, never even talked on the phone.

It was just all over the email.

And they said, hey, do you want to move to San Diego and work full time with us?

And I said absolutely.

So I took my mom''s car and I just drove down and I met them and I think they were kind of weirded out because they didn''t expect a 15 year old to show up.

and they weren''t even sure if that was legal and I was like oh no don''t worry I looked into it it''s totally legal here''s a work permit that I got from my school which is really just a work permit I had forged and printed out and I just started working with this company down in San Diego and that was really cool and that allowed me to support myself and my mom and she continued to live in LA but I got to start my own life down there which is really great.

That is incredible.

And San Diego, as a teenager, Sammy was working as a programmer, but eventually took on the responsibilities of a systems administrator.

He was making pretty good money for his age, then someone in LA tried to recruit him to work at a startup, and this was the deal, quit your job and come work for us.

Initially, we can''t pay you, but you can have some equity in the company and sleep on a founder''s couch while the startup gets off the ground.

And I said, oh, thanks for that offer now.

Thank you.

And he said, well, what do you want to do with your life?

What do you want to do the next few years?

I thought that was a really good question.

I honestly had not thought about it.

This is not something I normally think about.

And I thought about it for a while.

And I was like, well, I want to learn how to start a company.

I want to learn how to start a successful company that employs people and works on cool projects.

He said, OK, well, I just sold my last company for $30 million cash.

I''ve started multiple companies, I''ve done this before, so why don''t you meet my co-founder and learn with me and you can handle the technical side and Thought about that for a second and it''s like well, I probably won''t get that opportunity ever again So I sort of jumped in and I said, okay, let''s do that We put my job in San Diego came back up to LA slept on his couch and that''s when we started a company called Flanality Finality was creating voice over IP solutions for companies.

Sammy wasn''t getting paid at first.

He had some savings but was blowing through it pretty quick and living as cheap as possible, sleeping on a couch.

But eventually the company started making money, which meant Sammy started getting paid.

Then I think after we were actually making money, because we had become profitable at some point, and then I had a salary and then that salary grew as we came more profitable and didn''t get more rounds and stuff.

So, at some point, I was really fortunate to be able to still support my mom and also have some nice toys.

Things were really looking good for Sammy at this point.

He was 19 years old, making great money at a company that he helped create.

Sammy was a smart young lad, but eventually he got bored.

What do you get when you have a bored hacker?

Yeah, you guessed it.

Trouble.

That''s when I started playing with my space.

My space was the number one site on the internet, and all my friends had, and I sort of held off for a while, and then one day I said, okay, it''s pretty much all my friends have it, so I should just go on there and make an account, see what this is about.

And I made an account, I was like, oh, this is pretty cool, it''s a social network, you can post pictures, and you can post some people''s, I guess you call them profiles back then, and they didn''t have, you wouldn''t call them walls.

If you could have music that auto played, there''s just terrible.

You could do really awful CSS things to your page, but you could also do cool things.

And I really like that.

I actually really appreciate the fact that you could style the page in any way you want it.

You really could beam it and show a little personality.

I thought that was really cool and not something you get to do every day anymore.

So I made a profile, and at this point, pretty technically confident, or I felt that way.

and I thought, well, maybe I can make my profile cooler than some of my friends.

Just more interesting or unique.

So I started saying, all right, well, I could do all the CSS stuff, but how can I really do something interesting?

And I started looking and I think I had gotten like a digital camera and I found that the limitation on the profile pictures was, you can only have some photos.

And I thought it''d be funny just to have a 13th photo.

Like, it''s just a limitation that they had.

No one would really notice, you''d really have to think about it or know this limitation even to realize but I thought that would be sublimating.

funny.

Sammy figured out that the limitation on the number of photos that my space users were allowed to post was set by client side validation.

He realized he could bypass this validation and talk directly to the API server.

And he could submit as many photos as he wanted to my space.

And it worked.

Unbelievable.

So cool.

But now that he had bypassed one validation check, he wondered what What else could he do when you look at a Myspace users profile?

You can see what birthday they have displayed, what their favorite foods are, their music and movies, but there''s also a place to describe your relationship status.

There was a little drop down box.

You could pick single, married, engaged, or in a relationship, but you were bound to only be able to pick one of these that were in the drop down box.

There was no way to enter your own relationship status.

I wanted mine to say in a hot relationship.

That would be funny.

And again, a subtle change.

You couldn''t really do that.

At least back then with that version of CSS.

But I started playing around and said, well, maybe I can execute JavaScript.

Because JavaScript should be able to modify the DOM, modify the page in any way I want.

And I started playing around and found that they pretty much blocked JavaScript in any possible way.

So then I started saying, okay, well, maybe I can mess with the browser.

So I started looking to exploit the browser''s interpretation of tags and found that yes, there''s actually a way that I could execute JavaScript that technically isn''t compliant with say the W3C stack of how HTML should be interpreted, but browsers happen to be pretty lenient and they want web pages to work even if the developer made in there.

So I found a way to execute JavaScript within a CSS tag and then access some data somewhere else on the page and execute JavaScript note.

And this was really cool.

So this allowed me to now change my interrelationship to interrelationship.

Well, another fun and awesome win for Sammy.

At this point, he''s conducted two hacks against Myspace and is looking to see what else he can do.

He realized that when he changed the relationship status, he could get the browser to execute whatever JavaScript he wanted.

But it''s not just that, he could get whoever visited his profile to execute the JavaScript code that he wrote.

To be able to control the browser of whoever visits his page, this was a seriously big deal.

And at that point, it''s like, what else could I do that could be fun?

I started playing around.

I was just doing silly things.

I wanted to see, okay, if someone visited my profile and were not already friends, can I make them at me as a friend?

And I could.

And then I found, well, if I can control their browser, couldn''t I just update their own profile?

And I found, yeah, whenever they visit my profile, I could make them update anything on their profile.

And I didn''t want to be malicious.

I just wanted to do something that I thought was funny.

So I made it so that if you visit my profile, you''d not only would you add me as a friend, but then you would add most of all samis my hero to the bottom of your profile.

I thought that would be kind of funny and after a few days maybe a few of my friends would have it on their profiles and I could just be like hey cool you know point that out to them.

So I release this and a few days go by and nothing really happens like virtually none of my friends have hit it because a lot of people aren''t going to my profile.

So I think okay well how do I make this spread a little faster?

And I''m thinking, all right, if I can make you add me as a friend and add me as a hero to your profile, couldn''t I just copy the code to your profile as well?

So that way, if someone visits that profile, they''ll also add me as a friend, add me as a hero, and then the code will copy to their profile.

So within my friend group, it should probably hit them all within a week or so, and that will be pretty funny.

Someone will complain, and it''ll be taken down, and it''ll be good.

I launch it one night, and I go to sleep, and I wake up hoping to get at least a couple of hits, and unfortunately, I wake up to 10,000 new friends.

10,000 new friends?

Sammy was just trying to have some fun.

He didn''t intend to be malicious, But then it dawned on him.

He''s actually created a virus on my space.

Anyone who visited his profile would immediately add him as a friend.

But then the code to add Sammy as a friend was copied to that person''s profile.

So anyone who visited that person''s profile now had the code to add Sammy as a friend and it just kept spreading.

A virus that spreads itself like this is not just a virus.

It''s a worm.

Sammy has just created a MySpace worm, and it''s spreading way beyond what he thought it would become.

Perhaps he could get a few dozen friends, or even a hundred new friends.

But now he''s got 10,000 new friends, and it''s just constantly going up.

At that point, I just freak out.

I have no idea what to do.

I''m seeing my apartment, and I''m kind of baffled.

So I realized, oops, I just wrote a virus.

And what should I do?

And the problem with the virus is you can''t just remove it like I could remove it from my own profile But that doesn''t mean it''s gonna stop spreading because it''s already spread to thousands of profiles Where you get inflited with messages as well like, you know, you''re just really popular at the same time is having friends People were messaging me they''re like, hey, why are you on my profile?

Hey, every time I try to delete you You come back.

That''s because every time they would delete me from their profile It would return them to their own profile which re-excuted the code which reacted me as a friend So they couldn''t actually delete the virus either themselves, so they really needed my space to do that.

So at that point, I''m like, okay, it''s time for damage control as much as I can do.

So I email my space anonymously.

Hi, I''m a random user of my space.

I have no idea what''s going on.

There''s some weird stuff on my profile.

It looks like a bunch of obfuscated code, and I''m not really sure what it does.

But I think it does detailed explanation of exactly what was going on.

And I think you can fix it by, here''s a detailed explanation of exactly how to fix this problem.

I just prayed that they got it.

Well, I just continued my day.

I mean, at that point, I really couldn''t thank you, so I drove to the office.

In the whole time he''s at work, he''s looking at his Myspace profile and just watching the number of friends he has, rising higher and higher and higher.

150,000, 100,000.

I could not think about anything, I was just refreshing, went home, 500,000, 600,000.

And 600,000 knew my space friends.

Oh, this is going way out of control.

This has to be stopped.

Sammy tried to stop the worm by removing the code on his profile.

I removed the code from my own profile, but that doesn''t do anything, right?

It only removes it so that anyone who is my profile doesn''t get it, but it''s already spreading from anyone else, right?

Once someone else has it, it would just continue to spread.

So there''s no other way to really control it.

Really, my space would have to remember themselves.

Sammy goes off to work, does his shift, comes back home.

600,000, 700,000 it hits a million I just take a screenshot because now I''m just like that''s with a lot of people I had no idea that many people were even on my space.

I just had no idea how big it was I was hoping it would hit a hundred max Over the course of a week or a month or something once it was 10,000 I knew I had done something wrong.

That was I was like, oh, I did not think this through I was just freaked out the entire time.

I was super super concerned because I mean if it hit 10,000 overnight then at that point it was obvious oh yeah it''s just gonna grow ridiculously out of proportion and now I''m refreshing purely because I''m curious how fast it''s spreading so I''m refresh I refresh I refresh and at this point it''s spreading at about 3,000 people per second and as I''m sort of doing this little test of how fast it''s moving I refresh once again and finally my profile has been taken down so I''m pretty happy about this so then I was wondering okay the virus was probably up for about 20 hours.

And I''m thinking, all right, well, does it still say same as my hero and other people''s profiles?

Like, how did they take this down?

So I go to someone else''s profile.

And then I see that that profile is also down like, oh, no.

So I go to myspace.com, just to the website.

And it says, the whole site is down, the whole team is here working on it.

I felt absolutely awful.

I know what it''s like to have servers that are down and I would never want to do that to somebody.

And I''m thinking, okay, the number one site on the internet is down.

And I also recall that MySpace had just been purchased by Fox for half a billion dollars.

And I didn''t really want Fox to come after me.

So I was like, oh no, what do I do?

So I thought about it.

And MySpace is in LA.

So maybe I should just drive over there with some coffee and donuts and be like, hey guys, I''m Sammy.

I''m so sorry.

Can I help do anything?

Can I write some SQL queries?

What can I do?

But I thought that would be a bad idea.

In case they were just really upset, which I would totally understand is where I''d go to jail.

I had no idea what the ramifications of something like this was.

I really had no idea.

Did you tell anyone then?

What did your friends think of this at this point?

Because I mean, the people you work with and stuff, did they know that day?

Like, hey, it''s going crazy.

Your friends, did they know?

And you''re like, hey, and call one of them and say, I think I just took my space down.

I messaged like one or two friends about it.

I should remember explicitly one friend, I messaged just before doing it.

And he''s like, hey, don''t do that.

He was much smarter than I was.

And I think during the thing, I don''t think I''d talk to anyone about it.

My girlfriend, Gred told her, and she thought the whole thing was funny.

And really back then, it was just a social network, it was a small social network, really nothing compared to the networks we have today like Facebook and Twitter.

Granted, it was the largest of the time, but it was 2005, like smartphones had not come out.

There''s a much smaller people in the internet I just didn''t seem as serious.

At this point, my space is down, like the whole website.

Sammy is worried and scared.

The team at my space is probably totally freaking out.

This was the largest social networking site in the world at the time, and it''s down because Sammy decided to have a laugh?

This is not good.

Sammy''s anxiety is growing every minute that the site is down.

He can''t focus on real life right now.

Forget about work, forget about going out with friends.

was what the heck happened to my space?

Was it his worm that took down my space?

How much trouble would he be in if it was?

Hours went by and the site was still down and he was getting more and more anxious as he kept refreshing the page, weeding for it to come back up.

And then hours after the site went down, my space came back online.

Actually, I feel very good that the site is up a few hours later and this way I don''t really know what to do.

like sit around and we''ll start working on other things.

I''m kind of just waiting for the police to come knock on my door.

And a day goes by and a week goes by and I start getting emails from random people on the internet, blog writers and magazines that are like, hey, you know, we heard about the sperm you wrote.

I''m like, I don''t know what you''re talking about.

And they said, is your name Sammy?

I was like, yeah, my name''s Sammy, but you know, I''m not sure what you''re talking about.

And then they sent me a picture and they''re like, is this you?

And it''s my profile picture.

So It was, of course, it''s me and, like, okay, fine.

That was me.

And they started asking, you know, what was this spell?

Like, what was your intention?

This is just a prank on terribly wrong.

They asked, is my state content to you?

And I said, no.

Have the police contacted you?

I say, no.

And a week goes by, two weeks, three months.

Finally, after three months, I''m like, okay.

I''m super fortunate.

No one for my states or police or anything you ever have contacted me.

So, I''m really, really lucky.

I did something pretty dumb.

I''m never doing that again.

And sort of got away, it''s got free.

What a lesson learned, huh?

To accidentally take down the largest social network in the world and not hear from my space or the police, lucky guy.

Because you know what?

Sammy''s fingerprints are all over this worm.

I mean, the worm follows Sammy.

And then the worm actually says, above all, Sammy is my hero.

So it would be really easy for my space to track this back to Sammy, but nothing.

So Sammy just goes back to his regular life, back to his job at finality, which is starting to pay him even more now.

In fact, he was making enough to buy his dream car.

I got a Porsche boxer at the age of 19.

Anyway, he got a brand new car and one day he''s leaving his apartment and he goes down the elevator to the parking garage.

I''m walking down to it, but it''s a brand new car and I see two guys like this standing next to it sitting on it and I''m like oh no I''m getting card jacked and two more guys walk up behind me and then they say Sammy and I was like oh no I realized like card jackers they don''t know your name and they say Sammy we have a search warrant for you this was a surprise six months ago is when he launched a MySpace worm and now they''re coming for him these were representatives from the Secret Services Electronics Crimes Task Force, the LA District Attorney''s Office and the California Highway Patrol.

The highway patrol was there because they had suspicion that Sammy''s fancy new car might have been stolen.

The agents took Sammy into custody and head back up to his apartment.

We all walk up and as we go into my place, there''s a dozen agents already there going through everything.

And what they''re doing is they''re taking everything.

So anything that has data, CD, DVD, my laptop, my computer, my Xbox, and even my iPod was probably worse.

They took my iPod.

All my music was gone.

I loved music, so that was actually somewhat challenging.

Because all my MP3s and any legitimate or illegitimate music I had was gone.

And I was kind of terrified, but also, as someone go with the flow, you know, things happen in life, and you deal with them.

And I''m just waiting for sort of all this to be over, and now I''m reading Search One, because I really want to find out, Like, is this about my space?

Is this about something else?

Is this about some computers I hacked into?

I have no idea.

And I''m reading through, reading through, and then finally I see the words myspace.com.

Okay, good.

So it''s about that.

At least that one was a prank.

Then I''m reading, reading, reading, and then I see another address that they''re allowed to search.

And it''s my office.

So I asked them, are you guys gonna search my office?

They''re like, we''re already there.

One of the ages asked me, what''s that on your counter?

So in my living room, there was a table and it had some equipment on it, some smart card reader writer stuff and some smart cards stuff.

And it''s like, what are you doing with that?

And at this point, I think, okay, the Secret Service agent just asked me what these smart cards are.

And in my head, I''m like, should I tell them or should I lie about what this is?

And my friend was staying at my apartment for work at my company.

And I was showing him that I had to hack the laundry machines in our apartment building so that I could get free laundry.

And I was basically cloning smart cards or like replaying the information from a smart card to make it appear that it had more money than it did and I decided I should not lie to these people so I just told them that and fortunately they only just laughed and that''s nothing else came of that afterwards they collected everything and then they walked out and I''m like hey guys like are you taking me with you and they said no no you''re not under arrest at least for now and I said oh okay and they walked away and all of a sudden I just had no computers.

I went to the office.

Unfortunately, somehow the CEO was able to convince them that I was like an intern and that I had no access to anything, because when they came in, they said, hey, what to say?

I mean, can''t we have access to it?

The CEO was like, well, everything.

And they''re like, all right, guys, take everything.

This is a cloud-based company.

So when you take everything back then, we ran all the servers.

So they were about to take all of our servers, which would just bankrupt us instantly.

Fortunately, he convinced them something else that I was an intern or something weird, and they only took my stuff, just my computer, my phone.

And at that point, I got an attorney, and we ended up basically fighting with the LADA for about six months.

The Los Angeles DA charged Sammy with modifying data on a remote machine.

In settlement talks, prosecutors proposed that Sammy served some time in prison and not be able to use his computer for the rest of his life.

Keep in mind that Sammy was supporting his mother, and as a high school dropout, his only skill set in his livelihood We''re entirely dependent on using a computer.

Semi was so bright and gifted and passionate about computers and technology on the internet and hacking.

You can imagine how scary it was for him to face the prospect of having to live the rest of his life without ever being able to use a computer again.

Probably the hardest part, really the hardest part of anything I think, at least for me, is not knowing what an outcome will be.

I think it''s much easier to deal with, maybe even the most challenging outcome.

If I know that''s going to happen, you just tell me, okay, I''m going to go to the prison for the rest of my life, then I can at least mentally try to prepare for that.

But not knowing was just really difficult to deal with.

But ultimately, I took a plea agreement with them.

And the plea agreement was no prison time, so that was nice.

However, I would not be able to touch a computer for the rest of my life.

That was still in there.

And probation indefinitely, I would have to pay some restitution, I''d have to do a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

' a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

In fact, it also explicitly stated I could not access MySpace.com, so in case I somehow was able to access it without the internet of our computer.

So that was it.

Sammy had lost everything.

I mean, forget about the Porsche at this point, because on top of all this, they gave him a $20,000 fine.

So between having to pay all the lawyers and the fine and still having to support his mom, yeah, he was almost completely wiped out, almost back to zero, living as cheap as possible.

But still, forget all that.

I don''t think Sammy carried about the money at this point.

He was back to trying to figure out what he should do with his entire life.

No internet for life?

Everything he''s been working towards, all his skills and knowledge are useless now.

Sammy had 720 hours of community service he had to complete.

So every Saturday morning, he''d get up at 5 a.m. and go clean trash on the side of the highway for years.

Even if he did six hours every Saturday, that''s still just 300 hours a year, so everything about Sammy''s life was changed.

And he had to find new things to do that didn''t involve a computer to keep himself busy.

But I was really fortunate.

I mean, I met new people, I spent all that time just sort of doing other things that I had never really spent time doing.

I went outside, I saw the sun was like, ah, it''s so bright, but I got used to it.

that I made friends, I turned 21, so I get started going out meeting people, started learning to socialize a lot more.

So it''s really, really beneficial to me and something I wouldn''t really change today learned so much from that experience.

And I think it was good for someone so introverted and so stuck to a computer to be able to go out and experience other things.

So Sammy spent years of his life offline, doing his community service and trying to socialize with his friends.

But the story doesn''t end here.

After the break, Sammy gets to use computers again.

This episode is sponsored by Grammarly.

It''s pretty daunting.

Starting the work day and seeing unread messages here, unread emails there, and some documents you''ve got to go over and edit.

10 minutes in and you''re already drowning in the tabs you have open.

I find the key to managing multiple tasks is to focus on finishing each task one by one.

After two years of probation, Sammy has served all 720 hours of his community service.

He had great behavior.

The probation officer didn''t find anything wrong that Sammy did.

And since he had such great behavior, they went back to court to see if he could get the probation lifted.

And after a few years, I went back to court, and today, you know, my probation officer loves me.

It says I''m our favorite client, and they said, okay, you are a lot of touch computers again.

That was a very interesting experience.

I felt really weird touching the computer afterwards.

We kind of just get used to the rules that you''re abiding by, and it''s definitely an awkward feeling jumping back in.

What happens on that day that you got it back?

I definitely remember that day because I drove to the LA Courthouse and after I left the courthouse, I drove to the office store and found whatever the latest, you know, top of the line.

I don''t even think it was a MacBook.

It might have been a power book at that time.

I bought the top of the line power book and I went to a coffee shop.

I pulled it open and I connected to the Wi-Fi and I visited a couple of websites, so I think I visited the flash drive just to see what''s going on.

And I just felt really weird and I just shut the laptop and I went to go hang out with friends.

This started the next chapter in Sammy''s life.

Now that he was free to use the computer again, he eventually got back into it, way into it.

Even though he hadn''t been allowed to use a computer for the last two years, he had spent that time thinking of all sorts of things he can do with them.

During that time that I had no internet, I had no computers.

I started thinking about new exploits, new ways to really manipulate more systems and like exploit routers and exploit firewalls and just had some concepts literally just in my head and I couldn''t confirm whether they were accurate or not, whether they would work after I came back online.

And I started thinking, well, this stuff is fun.

Like maybe I can do this stuff, but not impact websites, not impact people negatively.

So how can I investigate the technology around us, look for the vulnerabilities around us and then share that information publicly in an entirely legal way so people actually understand the problems and can use solutions.

So just six months after Sammy had completed his probation for hacking my space, as 2008, Sammy was around 21 years old and starts looking into hacking credit cards, specifically the NFC and RFID chips on them.

Yeah, some other researchers and myself, we''re looking at these NFC credit cards which are becoming a lot more ubiquitous today but back then it was fun kind of funny they actually came out with these credit cards with NFC and pretty quickly they were encrypted somewhere encrypted however you could actually just buy a chip with the decryption key so you would just buy a chip from a company and you could then decrypt anyone''s credit card access their credit card info and then literally steal stuff with it and that was not my intention But I want to show that this stuff is not secure, so I just created a proof of concept that opened up this to some additional credit cards And there were some other tools that did similar things for other types of credit cards And I know mine was like a visa chase card that no one hadn''t done this for yet How close to someone do you have to be to get their credit card details?

Like does it work from far away?

I haven''t really experimented with how far you can do it So I''m not sure you do need to be close to them It''s very easy to be within proximity of many many people you just go to a crowded place and now you can see all many, many credit cards and then you can go home and buy a ton of stuff online or you can sell those credit cards online and really just steal money.

Even just bumping up against someone in the line, if they have an NFC or RFID vulnerable credit card in their pocket, that would be good enough to steal their credit card, right?

That''s correct.

That''s such a trip.

You know what''s funny is after releasing that and demonstrating that NFC then disappeared from our credit cards and it only recently re-emerged in the past few years and now with much stronger cryptography and additional safeguards from these sorts of tax.

However, there are other attacks.

I mean, it will always be cat and mouse right now.

Nothing is ever perfectly secure and to be fair, it''s much easier to be the attacker.

Well, Sammy studied how to hack the chips within credit cards.

He never did anything malicious with this.

He never actually stole anyone''s credit cards that he didn''t have permission to steal.

Instead, he started blogging about this and teaching others about the safety involved with these products in an attempt to make them more secure.

And from then on, Sammy would continue to research the security of so many more things, but always in an ethical and safe way.

He would do this on his own equipment and disclose what he found to vendors.

For instance, Sammy recently released a proof of concept to show how you can steal passwords and encryption keys by just listening.

This sort of stuff has been done for years by other people, by researchers, and I''m just trying to see can I do this on a two dollar chip or an Arduino that many people know how to use and many makers can just buy off the shelf and then they perform these types of attacks.

There''s a tax out there where researchers have demonstrated just taking a phone, a regular phone, putting it near a computer, and when a computer is doing some sort of cryptographic operation and maybe it''s encrypting an email, maybe it''s trying to send some Bitcoin, maybe it''s doing a financial transaction, maybe it''s logging into a bank.

When any of these things are being done and the processor is like processing those instructions in a certain order, Well, the processor requires power and different instructions require different amounts of power.

So, addition will be less power than a multiplication, which is really just a bunch of additions.

And you can then measure that power, but if you have a phone, you can use the microphone.

So, let''s say I''ve put a phone next to someone''s laptop and they''re encrypting an email with like the secret key.

Well, when that CPU is pulling power from all these capacitors, those capacitors are going through this thing called electro-strictive effect and they''re physically moving inside your computer and they''re moving at a speed, a rate against the circuit board inside that produces ultrasound.

You and I can''t hear ultrasound, but the phones that we have, the mobile devices we have, those microphones actually can listen all the way into the ultrasound range.

And if you have, say, an Android device with a microphone enabled and it listens to that ultrasound, you can then look at that sound, that amplitude or the volume of the sound, And then correlated and say, well, the higher the sound, the more power those capacitors are using and feeding to the CPU.

And if I know it''s this much power for this long, well, I can do timing and power analysis and say, well, that means you''re doing an addition here or you''re probably doing a jump or a branch here or a comparison here.

And this looks like you''re doing an AES encryption at 128 bit key.

And, you know, if you''re encrypting with a zero bit or so one bit, that''s going to take different instructions with different amount of power.

and then I can fully recover that key.

It''s pretty impressive.

And these are the types of attacks that are really explaining physical phenomena, right?

Things that a software developer might implement something perfectly, but there''s still these other attacks.

Sammy continued finding new areas to do security research in.

And at some point, he got interested in cookies.

Cookies are what web browsers use to remember who you are.

So when you return to a website, they can log you in or show you content that''s just for you.

So cookies are a tracking mechanism, and browser store these cookies on the user''s computer.

In a very specific location, but as Sammy looked into it, he was noticing some websites figured out a way to track users without storing the cookie in that traditional location.

For instance, some sites ran Flash to display fancy graphics.

Well, when you get to that website, the Flash video is downloaded and stored on your computer, and the next time you go to that website, your browser checks to see if you already have that video or if you need to download it.

But people were really concerned because some researchers found that some companies were using flash to store cookies on people''s computers.

And the benefit of this was that if a user deletes their normal cookies, their normal web browser or cookies, which is what advertisers used to track you, well, then the flash cookie was essentially acting as a backup, right?

And really serotoniously, because they obviously did that intentionally because they knew users might delete their omics.

And I was thinking, well, the browser was a pretty powerful piece of software until a lot of things.

I wonder what other mechanisms where I could actually store information locally.

And again, this is sort of a proof of concept to demonstrate what are all the ways that we can store information on a person''s computer whether they know it or not.

So I created this open source JavaScript library called EverCookie and it used normal cookies.

So it essentially generated random ID to track somebody.

And then you store it in their normal cookies, you store it in flash cookies.

But then I tried to find every possible other mechanism that you could use locally.

So there were silver lights.

So you silver light storage and then Java and HTML5 came out.

So then there was local storage and session storage, global storage, SQL light, local cache, your web history.

My friend Matt came up with a really cool idea of just storing the data in an image that would get cached.

And then you could actually read out the pixels of an image and then converted it back to an ID, all sorts of stuff.

And that was people like Matt and other people also started contributing to this project as it''s an entirely open source project on GitHub that that anyone can actually contribute to.

This ever cookie project that Sammy made really demonstrated how easy it is for websites to track their users even if they delete their cookies.

And this was a really effective technique.

So effective that when Snowden released a bunch of classified documents about what the NSA is doing, in there it even said that the NSA sometimes uses ever cookie to track its users through tour.

A couple people pointed out to me over the years that different governments have been using ever cookie to try to track people.

And it definitely feels good that a lot of governments are using my software, granted they''re doing it for a reason that I''m not into.

But I actually think the net gain of the entire project is extremely positive because whatever cookie really provided and still provides today is an asset test.

So now browsers essentially can use ever cookie to see, okay, does my private mode, does my incognito mode, does that provide the necessary protection to make get challenging to track this user, at least using local storage mechanisms.

And before ever cookie, there was nothing like that.

So no one knew about many of these techniques, and it''s very trivial for any company or government to then generate their own techniques.

But by consolidating it into a very simple to use the library, and always trying to keep it up to date, you know, people today are still updating ever cookie with new techniques.

Modern browsers that want to provide consumers and users and businesses privacy, it gives in that capability, because they know, okay, I''ve tested it at least against Evercooki, which is sort of state of the art and local storage mechanisms, and Evercooki can''t track it, so at least it makes it very difficult.

So governments who are using it, they''re really only able to track all browser users who don''t upgrade their browsers to operating systems.

Where people who actually do care about their privacy, those people typically know to use modern up-to-date software.

So I think the overall net gain is extremely beneficial.

Let''s talk about Skyjack then, because I think this is a really cool project.

What is Skyjack?

Skyjack started when I started hearing that Amazon was potentially going to use drones to deliver packages.

And I thought that was really cool, I mean, I think it''s really awesome that we have drones.

I think drones are super interesting, they''re low cost, and they''ll probably enable a lot of really useful things for humans.

However, I was somewhat concerned that that was the idea.

was like delivering just packages because I don''t really know if there''s any security on drones.

So I wasn''t sure I really didn''t know anything about drones so I went out and I bought the most ubiquitous consumer drone and then soon after I also bought industrial drones, type of drones that police use.

And immediately I started looking to see what are the protection mechanisms at least in the consumer drone and immediately I found absolutely zero.

Literally none.

You know one drone was using essentially Wi-Fi to be controlled and you could hijack that connection.

You could only have one person controlling the drone at a time, so if I would just essentially kick that person off and then I would take over and then I would modify the drone software so that the person could never log back in and then I would have full control and I found that I could do that and then I started looking at more industrial drones and found that they did have encryption.

However, that encryption was not good at all.

Basically, if you sat on a radio frequency channel, essentially it''s doing frequency hopping, So the transmitter is jumping around to different frequencies for various reasons, partially security, partially to prevent jamming or if there''s a lot of interference that interference will disappear after it hops to the next frequency.

But that was also based off the encryption key.

I found a packet sit on a single frequency and I see two packets come in from that drone, essentially it would have hopped hundreds of times.

And then I jump onto another frequency and I see it hopped on that frequency two times.

all of that would typically take a couple seconds tops.

I would then be able to reverse the key within a second.

I would be able to understand what the encryption key is and then I would be able to hop along and take over that drone as well.

So at that point I put all of this into an open source project called Skyjack.

I put on GitHub and I took a Raspberry Pi Linux computer.

I put my software on it.

I added some Wi-Fi transceivers and some sub-gigaheads transceivers for the industrial drones and you would then attach this Raspberry Pi to your own drone, and you''d fly your own drone around, and while you''re flying your drone around, Skyjack ever saw another drone on any of these wireless frequencies or within wireless range, it would then hijack and take over that drone, and you would now be in control of both drones.

In fact, any wireless drones found in the vicinity, you would take over all of them, and you''d be controlling a swarm of zombie drones entirely under your control from one transmitter.

And that was sort of the proof of concept there, and it was a really fun project, especially fun to be testing it.

Of course, I was testing only on my own drones that I owned, but it of course affected pretty much all models of old major drones at time.

No, I''ve flown a drone.

And one of those scariest feelings I''ve ever had is when you lose control of the thing and it just starts doing its own thing for whatever reason, right?

I mean, that''s a little bit evil what you''re doing here.

I''m not taking over anyone''s else''s drone.

I''ve only taken over my own.

Okay.

But giving the world the ability to do it, I don''t know.

I would disagree with that statement because the world has always had that capability of doing it, right?

How do you know people other people aren''t doing it already?

I would actually suspect that there are plenty of organizations who are doing it.

They''re just not going to tell you about it, right?

They''re not going to put it on the internet.

They''re not going to put it on GitHub and let you know that they''re taking over people''s drones or that they''ve developed the software and hardware necessary to do it.

They''re just going to create that and they''re going to stockpile it so that they can use it against people or companies or governments at their will.

That''s what we found when the NSA say leaks came out, we found out that they were stockpiling all of these vulnerabilities, including major, major vulnerabilities that affected many even the NSA that wants to protect America, knows that everyone''s running, say Windows computer, many people are running Windows computers, and they stockpiled Windows vulnerability zero days that nobody knew about.

It was only when one of these databases from the NSA was bleak that criminals were then able to use those exploits and actually attack many, many millions of computers around the internet, Americans and non-Americans, I don''t think it matters where you''re from.

So what I''m doing by releasing this stuff is demonstrating that, yes, this is the issue and you can patch it.

If I don''t release it, then the issue will continue to exist.

You might ask, well, why don''t I just directly communicate with the companies?

Often I do.

And I found over time that when you communicate directly with companies, they typically don''t resolve these sorts of things.

Unless you''re talking maybe existing, you know, specific software vulnerabilities in their architecture.

But if you''re saying, hey, you''re not using encryption or using like really wrong or it''s really the underlying protocol that is the issue.

I found that that''s when people don''t actually resolve anything.

And that''s when I started releasing stuff publicly and finding, oh, if you release a cool proof of concept that demonstrates the real problem, the underlying core problem, even if it''s not necessarily an issue with maybe the manufacturer, but rather a problem with the underlying protocol and just assumptions that were made, there is enough public pressure that causes that company to then resolve that issue due to the public pressure, not due to the vulnerability itself.

Because that''s often what companies are trying to do and no fault to them.

They''re trying to do what their customers want, right?

They''re trying to do what might move the needle for them.

And I found that this is an effective and appropriate way I believe to move the needle in a direction that I believe will help many people overall rather than just manufacture a company or a specific organization.

Has any company gotten upset with you and tried to come after you for some reason of disclosing vulnerabilities in their system publicly?

I''ve gotten seasoned assists many times, and it''s extremely fortunate that the EFF electronic frontier foundation, they have actually been very helpful to me, and they''re a nonprofit of attorneys who are really just looking for consumers and digital rights.

So your ability to have free speech online, your ability to inspect the software and hardware you use, the ability to own the things that you purchase.

I mean, there are companies who are trying to take this away from us.

But the EFF, I mean, really fortunate where they''ve defended me in some of these regards.

And so I''ve never had to succumb to and actually agree to assist to this day.

For the last decade, Sammy has continued to take on very interesting projects, hacking into stuff and exposing vulnerabilities.

Like another thing he found was that smartphones were tracking their users without their knowledge, which was a revelation that led to a class action lawsuit.

This all started because I was looking at I think a beta version of Firefox at the time.

And I was looking at the release notes and it talked about geolocation and I said cool that''s interesting like I''ve always been interested in location like being able to locate where someone is whether it''s on their cell phone or their computer or laptop or whatever.

And you know there''s always been these geo IP databases that sort of give you geography but really they''re or maybe accurate to the city, but often not.

And even city accuracy is not that great.

So I saw this thing about HTML5 geolocation and a Firefox data, and I started investigating, I wrote some code according to API of how it worked.

I ran it and all of a sudden, my browsers showed me exactly where I was.

Like literally, it showed me the physical address of my home.

And I was like, that''s absolutely crazy.

I''m on a laptop and my laptop does not have GPS.

I know that for a fact.

So how does it know where I am?

And I started sniffing the packets to see where it was going.

I mean, granted, you could just look at the source code.

It''s Firefox, so it''s open source.

And after sniffing, and I think maybe intercepting the TLS, I saw that it''s taking all of the wireless MAC address, all of the unique MAC addresses, all the routers around you, NAPs, and sending that to Google.

So even if your wireless routers are encrypted, and even if you don''t have one, and there are other people who have them, even if they''re encrypted, the MAC address is a unique identifier that isn''t unencrypted.

and your computer sends all of those to Google.

And Google returns the exact location that you''re located.

And you''re also sending only the wireless routers but the signal strength of each of them.

So then they can actually perform what''s called trilaterations, like triangulation, but essentially they use that signal strength and then really accurate this term where you are.

And I''m like, this is absolutely crazy.

How are they figuring all this out?

And I found that you''re basically sending all of these unique Mac addresses of all these routers around you and Google would send back.

your exact location.

So then I''m wondering, well, how does Google know where all these routers are?

And I thought about it some and I thought about some more and then I was, oh, there''s these Google Street View cars and these Google Street View cars are driving around and they have cameras on them and that''s where you get Street View from, right?

That really helpful feature of Google Maps where you can see like a Street View.

And I realized that they must have computers and like Wi-Fi systems on there that are also monitoring for these Wi-Fi Mac addresses and then correlating it with the GPS of the Street View Car and then uploading it all to Google and that''s how they''re getting this information.

It''s like that''s really clever.

And I started doing talks about this because I then found a way that I could essentially abuse that API and use it for myself whenever someone visit my website and I could see exactly where they were and I could even show them.

You''d come to my website, without your authorization, I could then send your Mac address and find where you are.

And I was talking about this in broader Slava and Slovakia and afterward someone said, say I mean, it''s interesting, but fortunately, you know, this does not apply to us because Google Street View cars are not allowed here.

Interesting.

So I''ll just give it a shot and try to running it, just confirm.

And oddly enough, it still worked.

It actually worked very accurately.

And it''s like, wait a second.

I don''t think Google''s lying.

I don''t believe that they are doing something illegal.

I don''t think they have Street View cars when they say they''re not doing that.

And you would notice, I mean, those cars stick out with with these massive sensors on top of them.

So what else might Google have access to, especially in somewhere random like Bratislava?

And I thought a little bit more and then realized, oh wait, Android phones.

There are Android phones everywhere.

And I wonder if these Android phones are actually we''re driving machines.

And after the reverse engineering, some binary blobs on Android devices, this was not actually in the source code that I could find.

I found these binaries that were essentially grabbing all Wi-Fi Mac addresses, is sending the signal strength of all these wireless routers up to Google along with GPS coordinates.

So essentially every Android phone in existence is a war driving machine for Google.

That''s grabbing all this information, grabbing all this location data.

So even if you don''t use an Android phone, other Android phones near you are then taking your routers information and sending it up with the location.

Sammy also figured out that iPhones were doing the same thing, but sending the data to Apple instead of Google.

And what''s worse is that in some cases, this was happening even after users turned off the location services or GPS.

Well, this was encrypted, so it took a little time to really understand what was going on in reverse engineering stuff.

And to really just demonstrate this as a fun proof of concept, I created a tool, really just a simple mobile app that behaved just like Google Maps.

And I found that Google was actually doing something really clever with their information, not only were they collecting where everyone was at all times via Android devices, but that''s also how they collect traffic.

So that''s how you know whether a street is green, yellow, or red, and whether there''s traffic or not in Google Maps is because all of the phones are constantly delivering their GPS location.

And if you time that, if you say, all right, I''m here now and in 10 seconds I''m here, well, you can calculate the distance they traveled over that time and know how fast they''re moving.

So that''s how they get Google Maps traffic.

So Sam, he thought about this for a minute and realized if the Android phones are the ones that are delivering data to Google and giving the traffic updates for the Google Maps, could he somehow exploit that?

Could he somehow trick Google servers into thinking there''s a traffic jam when there''s really not?

I created a app that was just like Google Maps and you''d start from point A and say, I''m at this location and I want to drive to wherever to West Hollywood.

And it would give you turn-by-turn directions.

But on those turn-by-turn directions of my route, it would sound only tangibly pretend to be thousands and thousands of other Android devices.

And all those devices, all those fake devices, would send up information to Google saying, hey, I''m one of these Android devices, and I''m moving zero miles per hour.

So all of a sudden, my route, the route that my app gave me, would turn red and black for everyone else, and they would get diverted to different routes on Google Maps.

And hopefully, my route would be a little bit faster as there would be less cars on the road.

And that was sort of my proof and concept to demonstrating this sort of this issue.

And I''ve some of this could even continue even when you turned off these features, like, location.

I love this hack.

To make it so wherever you drive, Google traffic is diverting drivers to go away from you because it''s congested wherever you are.

Even though it''s not congested where you are, you''re just sending fake data to Google.

It''s just brilliant.

Yeah, you know, it''s the proof of concept just to poke fun at the information and kind of just demonstrate like what this information is capable of doing.

While this is cool, the underlying issue here is that users were unknowingly sending their exact location to Google.

And I don''t know about you, but I don''t personally like that Google knows exactly where my phone is at all times.

I just think it''s a violation of privacy of some sort.

And you know what?

I''m not the only one who thinks that.

Yeah, so ultimately, you know, the biggest issue was that people weren''t accepting that A, they were sending all this data up.

So ultimately, Google and Apple had to appear on Capitol Hill because they previously said, no, we''re not tracking you.

And, you know, this research demonstrated that, yes, in fact, they were tracking exactly where you are virtually at all times.

And in some cases, it begins to your consent when you turned off location services on Apple.

Again, those devices were still sending information that allowed full location of where you were because it was sending Mac addresses, which they already knew where those were.

So it''s simply one step correlation in a database they already have.

So that''s not really fair to say that they''re not grabbing that information.

And ultimately, you know, they did resolve these things.

You know, it''s funny that the same thing is still happening, right?

All these phones are still doing the same things.

The only difference is now you click OK when they say they do it.

But the benefit here is that for people who don''t want this sort of technology to run, they can say no on their phone.

The scary thing, though, is that even if you don''t even have one of these phones, it''s all the phones around that are still collecting that information of your router, of the devices on your network, even though it''s somebody else''s device.

I saw a video the other day about a guy who put like a hundred Android cell phones all in a wagon and slowly walked down the road, and this triggered the Google location API thing to make it show that the road was really congested and made it turn red as well.

So it looks like this API is still under attack just by researchers and people doing weird stunts and stuff So yeah, Sammy has a pretty cool YouTube channel.

You should check that out And he''s also given a lot of talks at various conferences like she''s all over the world How many talks have you given at this point Sammy?

I don''t know maybe 50 or so Where are you working now and after all days?

I mean this is just such a whirlwind life you''ve had so far I''ve started a company called Open Path with some friends, and we''ve been growing quite a bit.

I''ve done some research in RFID and cloning badges, and being able to demonstrate how to break into buildings.

Many years ago, we found that technology has not changed in the 10 years since I''ve looked.

You know, wrote software that was able to clone badges and break into various levels of security for physical access for buildings.

And we were sitting around and thinking, well, you know, why is this still a problem?

And it''s still inconvenient.

Like, why do I have to carry around this thick card in my wallet?

like I''m trying to get rid of my wallet.

And we ended up building this business called Open Path where you could essentially have physical access control for businesses and buildings where, hey, you don''t need a card.

You could use a card if you wanted, but you could just use your phone.

Your phone actually has really strong encryption.

We have things like TLS, we have AES, we have open encryption standards that people have been trying to break for many, many years and haven''t that are entirely open and can be inspected by anyone.

So we''re using those technologies to essentially unlock doors and you don''t even need to pull your phone out.

You literally just get within Bluetooth range of one of these devices, then you can walk right in as long as you have authorization.

So we''re trying to really make a really modern and cloud-based and secure way of getting into buildings that is just really convenient because I''m just trying to get rid of the things in my wallet and this kind of technology is just really interesting.

Yes, that technology is interesting, but so much technology is interesting.

And we live in a time where technology is in abundance all around us.

And if you think about technology as much as Sammy does, it''s like a playground for him.

To be able to tinker with it all and take it apart and put it back together in ways it was never intended, Sammy''s hacker mindset is still going strong today and it will probably be strong for decades more to come, provided he doesn''t accidentally launch another warm and take down the largest social networking website once again.

A big thank you to Sammy Camcart for coming on and telling us all this.

Hey, it''s Jack, host of the show.

When I was a kid, I got an ant farm from my birthday.

It''s like two panes of glass with some sand in between and you can watch the ants dig tunnels and go about their day.

It was really cool, but when you get the ant farm, it doesn''t contain any ants.

You have to order the ants and they''re mailed to you.

And the first thing I thought about when I was a kid and I heard about this was, wait a minute, I can mail ants to anyone I want.

And I think that is basically the hacker mindset to completely ignore some things intended use and find new ways to employ it.

Today we''re going to talk with a hacker who sees the world this way and will hear all the joy and trouble it''s brought him over the years.

These are true stories from the dark side of the internet.

Okay, today we''re gonna have a chat with someone so infamous, he has his own worm named after him, the Sammy worm.

That''s right.

Today we''re talking with Sammy Camcar.

Sammy is a hacker in almost every way.

He does things he''s not supposed to do.

He''s the kind of guy that thinks buttons are toys and you push them for fun just to see what they do, which often ends up breaking something.

I was never malicious person at all.

So all this hacking, all of this exploitation, it''s really about a puzzle.

To me, this was all a puzzle, a really fun puzzle.

There''s a lot of reasons to call Sammy infamous.

But to tell his story, we need to go back to his childhood.

When I was nine years old, my mom bought me my first computer.

So I spent everything she had, so I''d have something to do during the summer.

She knew I lived computers.

I''d always go to the library with her or to her university and go and just spend all day at the library on the computers that they had.

And immediately I went online and I started searching for the ex files, which is obviously the best TV show of the time.

I found some message boards and that quickly became really frustrating to after a refresh and a wait for people to update that message board.

So then I found something called IRC, Internet Relay Chat.

And I jumped on, I went into a channel and said, hey, he wants a chat about the ex files.

and immediately someone told me, get out.

And I''m thinking, that''s weird.

This is like a random person I don''t know on the internet and they''re telling me to do something?

No. So I told the guy, no.

And then he said, you have 10 seconds to get out of this chapter.

And I said, no.

And 10 seconds later, the brand new computer that my mom spent everything on crashes.

I had a blue screen and I freaked out.

I had no idea what to do.

do.

I pulled the power from the back of the computer.

I waited about half an hour for all the bad stuff to get out of the computer.

I think that''s what you''re supposed to do.

And then I plugged it back in.

Unfortunately, it came back up.

Everything was fine.

But really with your adrenaline still rushing through my veins, I was thinking that is the coolest thing ever.

How do I do that?

From that point forward, Sammy was addicted to computers.

This was so fascinating to him.

He wanted to understand how this had been possible.

So he began studying computers and practicing programming.

Since he now had a computer at home, he got into video games too.

Counter-strike was his favorite game.

You know, the first person shooter, he played it a lot.

He was addicted to it.

It was fun.

I mean, it was a ton of fun.

I''ve had a clan and I was playing with a bunch of friends in high school and I remember just one day I was playing and I heard some footsteps.

My computer has two speakers, you know, one on the left side, one on the right side.

So some stereo sound and I hear some footsteps coming from the right speaker and then I hear them panning to the left speaker so that immediately tells me oh there''s someone behind me because I can''t see them in my visual field of view in the game.

So immediately I''m like wait, that means someone is behind me in the game.

This is a live person, someone else on the internet playing Counter Strike with me, but I can''t see them in my radar, which means they''re on the opposing team, so I wondered right then, couldn''t I really use that information, that sound information, on the computer itself?

I''m sure that person killed me pretty quickly, but afterwards I exited Counter Strike, and I started looking into how can I pull that information?

What''s telling the computer to play footsteps on the right speaker, rather than left speaker, because that means there''s positional information there that someone is on the right side versus the left side.

And sure enough, I started learning about packet sniffing and then memory injection and intercepting function calls within the DLLs of CounterStrike itself and intercepting basically everything between the binary, the CounterStrike executable and the DLLs that it used so that I could intercept things like footsteps.

And once I hooked that function, I was then able to get exact coordinates of everyone, because everyone''s footsteps is actually being sent to you.

At least within some range, you will then get that, and that''s just telling your computer where to play the sound.

But that location is exactly where that person''s located.

At that point, I started using OpenGL at the time, and just drawing where the user is on the map in a little heads-up display and a little radar.

And then I started jumping into writing counter-strike cheats software.

That was a lot of fun.

Where were some of the cheats you could do?

Just writing aim bots, so being automatically aiming at people, being able to make any smoke bomb or smoke grenade or flashbang, just make those transparent to me.

So I could go into a room that I knew is full of opposing team members and throw in a flashbang.

And they''re all going to see white for three seconds and I''m going to run in there and see absolutely nothing because I''ve hooked that function and said do nothing.

Just return out.

You know, do a return before you actually do any of the visualization to sort of wipe my screen.

and little things like that became really fun.

I couldn''t actually modify my health that was controlled by this server.

So I couldn''t actually make myself invincible, adding zoom to every weapon.

So weapons that didn''t normally have zoom or might have like a scope on them.

So you lose a lot of the screen because it''s now blacked out.

I would just remove those.

There''s no reason that it''s green to zoom blacked out.

I would remove that.

There''s no reason that zoom should be better in one weapon than not the other.

So I had to zoom to all weapons.

And this is all totally unfair.

and pretty quickly it actually became not fun at all.

Like all of the fun of the game went away entirely because all of a sudden it was practically god mode.

Sammy released the Counter Strike cheats as open source software.

He was beginning to get bored playing the game and then punk buster came out and punk buster is a program that''s designed to scan the memory to see if anyone is cheating in the game and punk buster stopped Sammy from using his cheats.

But now the new game was for Sammy to try to circumvent whatever punk buster was using to detect him.

All of a sudden this game was fun again, because I was no longer playing the game.

I was now playing against these engineers on punk buster.

They were doing their own memory inspection.

They were looking for my process.

They were doing all sorts of things to stop my cheats and other people''s cheats as well.

And that became fun.

At that point I was probably 15 years old.

So it''s so attached to this that I stopped going to high school and I started updating my cheats because this was just so fun and it would be cat and mouse.

So I would release a new version that defeated their software and two days later they would release a new version and then I would have to figure out what do they do, how do they figure it out.

And that was like training.

It was sort of very rapid training in how does at the very least software and networking work.

And I think I probably learned a ton just during that short stint when I was writing this cheats software.

at 16, you dropped out of high school, what did you do after that?

I wasn''t good at school.

I didn''t care about most classes, so I did not do well.

It was not a good learner.

No one ever taught me how to learn something.

I think that was something that I learned later in life.

I just wish there were tools that were taught at school for me.

I think I would have been a much better student.

However, if I''m enjoying something, then I will absolutely learn it.

I''ll spend all my time on it.

I''m still not necessarily a fast learner like I''ve always known that people can pick up stuff much faster than me But if there''s something I enjoy then I''m just gonna spend all my time on it and you know, I''m very persistent Sammy was living at home with his mom in Los Angeles at the time She had recently lost her job and now that she was home more often She noticed Sammy wasn''t going to school and told him if he''s not gonna go to school He needs to get a job to help pay the rent so Sammy started applying for any job he thought he could get.

I got an email out of the blue from a company in San Diego and said, hey, we saw your cheat software, your camera strike stuff.

And will you be willing to contract and just write code for us remotely?

And I was blown away.

I was like, wait, someone will pay me to write code.

Like, I thought this was just useful for basically writing cheat software.

Like, I had no idea that you could use it for other things.

I mean, it was obvious that you could sort of program things, but I just know someone would pay me money to do that.

So I was really, really fortunate in getting that email and I started working with them and just remotely writing code for them and they never met me.

I mean, never even talked on the phone.

It was just all over the email.

And they said, hey, do you want to move to San Diego and work full time with us?

And I said absolutely.

So I took my mom''s car and I just drove down and I met them and I think they were kind of weirded out because they didn''t expect a 15 year old to show up.

and they weren''t even sure if that was legal and I was like oh no don''t worry I looked into it it''s totally legal here''s a work permit that I got from my school which is really just a work permit I had forged and printed out and I just started working with this company down in San Diego and that was really cool and that allowed me to support myself and my mom and she continued to live in LA but I got to start my own life down there which is really great.

That is incredible.

And San Diego, as a teenager, Sammy was working as a programmer, but eventually took on the responsibilities of a systems administrator.

He was making pretty good money for his age, then someone in LA tried to recruit him to work at a startup, and this was the deal, quit your job and come work for us.

Initially, we can''t pay you, but you can have some equity in the company and sleep on a founder''s couch while the startup gets off the ground.

And I said, oh, thanks for that offer now.

Thank you.

And he said, well, what do you want to do with your life?

What do you want to do the next few years?

I thought that was a really good question.

I honestly had not thought about it.

This is not something I normally think about.

And I thought about it for a while.

And I was like, well, I want to learn how to start a company.

I want to learn how to start a successful company that employs people and works on cool projects.

He said, OK, well, I just sold my last company for $30 million cash.

I''ve started multiple companies, I''ve done this before, so why don''t you meet my co-founder and learn with me and you can handle the technical side and Thought about that for a second and it''s like well, I probably won''t get that opportunity ever again So I sort of jumped in and I said, okay, let''s do that We put my job in San Diego came back up to LA slept on his couch and that''s when we started a company called Flanality Finality was creating voice over IP solutions for companies.

Sammy wasn''t getting paid at first.

He had some savings but was blowing through it pretty quick and living as cheap as possible, sleeping on a couch.

But eventually the company started making money, which meant Sammy started getting paid.

Then I think after we were actually making money, because we had become profitable at some point, and then I had a salary and then that salary grew as we came more profitable and didn''t get more rounds and stuff.

So, at some point, I was really fortunate to be able to still support my mom and also have some nice toys.

Things were really looking good for Sammy at this point.

He was 19 years old, making great money at a company that he helped create.

Sammy was a smart young lad, but eventually he got bored.

What do you get when you have a bored hacker?

Yeah, you guessed it.

Trouble.

That''s when I started playing with my space.

My space was the number one site on the internet, and all my friends had, and I sort of held off for a while, and then one day I said, okay, it''s pretty much all my friends have it, so I should just go on there and make an account, see what this is about.

And I made an account, I was like, oh, this is pretty cool, it''s a social network, you can post pictures, and you can post some people''s, I guess you call them profiles back then, and they didn''t have, you wouldn''t call them walls.

If you could have music that auto played, there''s just terrible.

You could do really awful CSS things to your page, but you could also do cool things.

And I really like that.

I actually really appreciate the fact that you could style the page in any way you want it.

You really could beam it and show a little personality.

I thought that was really cool and not something you get to do every day anymore.

So I made a profile, and at this point, pretty technically confident, or I felt that way.

and I thought, well, maybe I can make my profile cooler than some of my friends.

Just more interesting or unique.

So I started saying, all right, well, I could do all the CSS stuff, but how can I really do something interesting?

And I started looking and I think I had gotten like a digital camera and I found that the limitation on the profile pictures was, you can only have some photos.

And I thought it''d be funny just to have a 13th photo.

Like, it''s just a limitation that they had.

No one would really notice, you''d really have to think about it or know this limitation even to realize but I thought that would be sublimating.

funny.

Sammy figured out that the limitation on the number of photos that my space users were allowed to post was set by client side validation.

He realized he could bypass this validation and talk directly to the API server.

And he could submit as many photos as he wanted to my space.

And it worked.

Unbelievable.

So cool.

But now that he had bypassed one validation check, he wondered what What else could he do when you look at a Myspace users profile?

You can see what birthday they have displayed, what their favorite foods are, their music and movies, but there''s also a place to describe your relationship status.

There was a little drop down box.

You could pick single, married, engaged, or in a relationship, but you were bound to only be able to pick one of these that were in the drop down box.

There was no way to enter your own relationship status.

I wanted mine to say in a hot relationship.

That would be funny.

And again, a subtle change.

You couldn''t really do that.

At least back then with that version of CSS.

But I started playing around and said, well, maybe I can execute JavaScript.

Because JavaScript should be able to modify the DOM, modify the page in any way I want.

And I started playing around and found that they pretty much blocked JavaScript in any possible way.

So then I started saying, okay, well, maybe I can mess with the browser.

So I started looking to exploit the browser''s interpretation of tags and found that yes, there''s actually a way that I could execute JavaScript that technically isn''t compliant with say the W3C stack of how HTML should be interpreted, but browsers happen to be pretty lenient and they want web pages to work even if the developer made in there.

So I found a way to execute JavaScript within a CSS tag and then access some data somewhere else on the page and execute JavaScript note.

And this was really cool.

So this allowed me to now change my interrelationship to interrelationship.

Well, another fun and awesome win for Sammy.

At this point, he''s conducted two hacks against Myspace and is looking to see what else he can do.

He realized that when he changed the relationship status, he could get the browser to execute whatever JavaScript he wanted.

But it''s not just that, he could get whoever visited his profile to execute the JavaScript code that he wrote.

To be able to control the browser of whoever visits his page, this was a seriously big deal.

And at that point, it''s like, what else could I do that could be fun?

I started playing around.

I was just doing silly things.

I wanted to see, okay, if someone visited my profile and were not already friends, can I make them at me as a friend?

And I could.

And then I found, well, if I can control their browser, couldn''t I just update their own profile?

And I found, yeah, whenever they visit my profile, I could make them update anything on their profile.

And I didn''t want to be malicious.

I just wanted to do something that I thought was funny.

So I made it so that if you visit my profile, you''d not only would you add me as a friend, but then you would add most of all samis my hero to the bottom of your profile.

I thought that would be kind of funny and after a few days maybe a few of my friends would have it on their profiles and I could just be like hey cool you know point that out to them.

So I release this and a few days go by and nothing really happens like virtually none of my friends have hit it because a lot of people aren''t going to my profile.

So I think okay well how do I make this spread a little faster?

And I''m thinking, all right, if I can make you add me as a friend and add me as a hero to your profile, couldn''t I just copy the code to your profile as well?

So that way, if someone visits that profile, they''ll also add me as a friend, add me as a hero, and then the code will copy to their profile.

So within my friend group, it should probably hit them all within a week or so, and that will be pretty funny.

Someone will complain, and it''ll be taken down, and it''ll be good.

I launch it one night, and I go to sleep, and I wake up hoping to get at least a couple of hits, and unfortunately, I wake up to 10,000 new friends.

10,000 new friends?

Sammy was just trying to have some fun.

He didn''t intend to be malicious, But then it dawned on him.

He''s actually created a virus on my space.

Anyone who visited his profile would immediately add him as a friend.

But then the code to add Sammy as a friend was copied to that person''s profile.

So anyone who visited that person''s profile now had the code to add Sammy as a friend and it just kept spreading.

A virus that spreads itself like this is not just a virus.

It''s a worm.

Sammy has just created a MySpace worm, and it''s spreading way beyond what he thought it would become.

Perhaps he could get a few dozen friends, or even a hundred new friends.

But now he''s got 10,000 new friends, and it''s just constantly going up.

At that point, I just freak out.

I have no idea what to do.

I''m seeing my apartment, and I''m kind of baffled.

So I realized, oops, I just wrote a virus.

And what should I do?

And the problem with the virus is you can''t just remove it like I could remove it from my own profile But that doesn''t mean it''s gonna stop spreading because it''s already spread to thousands of profiles Where you get inflited with messages as well like, you know, you''re just really popular at the same time is having friends People were messaging me they''re like, hey, why are you on my profile?

Hey, every time I try to delete you You come back.

That''s because every time they would delete me from their profile It would return them to their own profile which re-excuted the code which reacted me as a friend So they couldn''t actually delete the virus either themselves, so they really needed my space to do that.

So at that point, I''m like, okay, it''s time for damage control as much as I can do.

So I email my space anonymously.

Hi, I''m a random user of my space.

I have no idea what''s going on.

There''s some weird stuff on my profile.

It looks like a bunch of obfuscated code, and I''m not really sure what it does.

But I think it does detailed explanation of exactly what was going on.

And I think you can fix it by, here''s a detailed explanation of exactly how to fix this problem.

I just prayed that they got it.

Well, I just continued my day.

I mean, at that point, I really couldn''t thank you, so I drove to the office.

In the whole time he''s at work, he''s looking at his Myspace profile and just watching the number of friends he has, rising higher and higher and higher.

150,000, 100,000.

I could not think about anything, I was just refreshing, went home, 500,000, 600,000.

And 600,000 knew my space friends.

Oh, this is going way out of control.

This has to be stopped.

Sammy tried to stop the worm by removing the code on his profile.

I removed the code from my own profile, but that doesn''t do anything, right?

It only removes it so that anyone who is my profile doesn''t get it, but it''s already spreading from anyone else, right?

Once someone else has it, it would just continue to spread.

So there''s no other way to really control it.

Really, my space would have to remember themselves.

Sammy goes off to work, does his shift, comes back home.

600,000, 700,000 it hits a million I just take a screenshot because now I''m just like that''s with a lot of people I had no idea that many people were even on my space.

I just had no idea how big it was I was hoping it would hit a hundred max Over the course of a week or a month or something once it was 10,000 I knew I had done something wrong.

That was I was like, oh, I did not think this through I was just freaked out the entire time.

I was super super concerned because I mean if it hit 10,000 overnight then at that point it was obvious oh yeah it''s just gonna grow ridiculously out of proportion and now I''m refreshing purely because I''m curious how fast it''s spreading so I''m refresh I refresh I refresh and at this point it''s spreading at about 3,000 people per second and as I''m sort of doing this little test of how fast it''s moving I refresh once again and finally my profile has been taken down so I''m pretty happy about this so then I was wondering okay the virus was probably up for about 20 hours.

And I''m thinking, all right, well, does it still say same as my hero and other people''s profiles?

Like, how did they take this down?

So I go to someone else''s profile.

And then I see that that profile is also down like, oh, no.

So I go to myspace.com, just to the website.

And it says, the whole site is down, the whole team is here working on it.

I felt absolutely awful.

I know what it''s like to have servers that are down and I would never want to do that to somebody.

And I''m thinking, okay, the number one site on the internet is down.

And I also recall that MySpace had just been purchased by Fox for half a billion dollars.

And I didn''t really want Fox to come after me.

So I was like, oh no, what do I do?

So I thought about it.

And MySpace is in LA.

So maybe I should just drive over there with some coffee and donuts and be like, hey guys, I''m Sammy.

I''m so sorry.

Can I help do anything?

Can I write some SQL queries?

What can I do?

But I thought that would be a bad idea.

In case they were just really upset, which I would totally understand is where I''d go to jail.

I had no idea what the ramifications of something like this was.

I really had no idea.

Did you tell anyone then?

What did your friends think of this at this point?

Because I mean, the people you work with and stuff, did they know that day?

Like, hey, it''s going crazy.

Your friends, did they know?

And you''re like, hey, and call one of them and say, I think I just took my space down.

I messaged like one or two friends about it.

I should remember explicitly one friend, I messaged just before doing it.

And he''s like, hey, don''t do that.

He was much smarter than I was.

And I think during the thing, I don''t think I''d talk to anyone about it.

My girlfriend, Gred told her, and she thought the whole thing was funny.

And really back then, it was just a social network, it was a small social network, really nothing compared to the networks we have today like Facebook and Twitter.

Granted, it was the largest of the time, but it was 2005, like smartphones had not come out.

There''s a much smaller people in the internet I just didn''t seem as serious.

At this point, my space is down, like the whole website.

Sammy is worried and scared.

The team at my space is probably totally freaking out.

This was the largest social networking site in the world at the time, and it''s down because Sammy decided to have a laugh?

This is not good.

Sammy''s anxiety is growing every minute that the site is down.

He can''t focus on real life right now.

Forget about work, forget about going out with friends.

was what the heck happened to my space?

Was it his worm that took down my space?

How much trouble would he be in if it was?

Hours went by and the site was still down and he was getting more and more anxious as he kept refreshing the page, weeding for it to come back up.

And then hours after the site went down, my space came back online.

Actually, I feel very good that the site is up a few hours later and this way I don''t really know what to do.

like sit around and we''ll start working on other things.

I''m kind of just waiting for the police to come knock on my door.

And a day goes by and a week goes by and I start getting emails from random people on the internet, blog writers and magazines that are like, hey, you know, we heard about the sperm you wrote.

I''m like, I don''t know what you''re talking about.

And they said, is your name Sammy?

I was like, yeah, my name''s Sammy, but you know, I''m not sure what you''re talking about.

And then they sent me a picture and they''re like, is this you?

And it''s my profile picture.

So It was, of course, it''s me and, like, okay, fine.

That was me.

And they started asking, you know, what was this spell?

Like, what was your intention?

This is just a prank on terribly wrong.

They asked, is my state content to you?

And I said, no.

Have the police contacted you?

I say, no.

And a week goes by, two weeks, three months.

Finally, after three months, I''m like, okay.

I''m super fortunate.

No one for my states or police or anything you ever have contacted me.

So, I''m really, really lucky.

I did something pretty dumb.

I''m never doing that again.

And sort of got away, it''s got free.

What a lesson learned, huh?

To accidentally take down the largest social network in the world and not hear from my space or the police, lucky guy.

Because you know what?

Sammy''s fingerprints are all over this worm.

I mean, the worm follows Sammy.

And then the worm actually says, above all, Sammy is my hero.

So it would be really easy for my space to track this back to Sammy, but nothing.

So Sammy just goes back to his regular life, back to his job at finality, which is starting to pay him even more now.

In fact, he was making enough to buy his dream car.

I got a Porsche boxer at the age of 19.

Anyway, he got a brand new car and one day he''s leaving his apartment and he goes down the elevator to the parking garage.

I''m walking down to it, but it''s a brand new car and I see two guys like this standing next to it sitting on it and I''m like oh no I''m getting card jacked and two more guys walk up behind me and then they say Sammy and I was like oh no I realized like card jackers they don''t know your name and they say Sammy we have a search warrant for you this was a surprise six months ago is when he launched a MySpace worm and now they''re coming for him these were representatives from the Secret Services Electronics Crimes Task Force, the LA District Attorney''s Office and the California Highway Patrol.

The highway patrol was there because they had suspicion that Sammy''s fancy new car might have been stolen.

The agents took Sammy into custody and head back up to his apartment.

We all walk up and as we go into my place, there''s a dozen agents already there going through everything.

And what they''re doing is they''re taking everything.

So anything that has data, CD, DVD, my laptop, my computer, my Xbox, and even my iPod was probably worse.

They took my iPod.

All my music was gone.

I loved music, so that was actually somewhat challenging.

Because all my MP3s and any legitimate or illegitimate music I had was gone.

And I was kind of terrified, but also, as someone go with the flow, you know, things happen in life, and you deal with them.

And I''m just waiting for sort of all this to be over, and now I''m reading Search One, because I really want to find out, Like, is this about my space?

Is this about something else?

Is this about some computers I hacked into?

I have no idea.

And I''m reading through, reading through, and then finally I see the words myspace.com.

Okay, good.

So it''s about that.

At least that one was a prank.

Then I''m reading, reading, reading, and then I see another address that they''re allowed to search.

And it''s my office.

So I asked them, are you guys gonna search my office?

They''re like, we''re already there.

One of the ages asked me, what''s that on your counter?

So in my living room, there was a table and it had some equipment on it, some smart card reader writer stuff and some smart cards stuff.

And it''s like, what are you doing with that?

And at this point, I think, okay, the Secret Service agent just asked me what these smart cards are.

And in my head, I''m like, should I tell them or should I lie about what this is?

And my friend was staying at my apartment for work at my company.

And I was showing him that I had to hack the laundry machines in our apartment building so that I could get free laundry.

And I was basically cloning smart cards or like replaying the information from a smart card to make it appear that it had more money than it did and I decided I should not lie to these people so I just told them that and fortunately they only just laughed and that''s nothing else came of that afterwards they collected everything and then they walked out and I''m like hey guys like are you taking me with you and they said no no you''re not under arrest at least for now and I said oh okay and they walked away and all of a sudden I just had no computers.

I went to the office.

Unfortunately, somehow the CEO was able to convince them that I was like an intern and that I had no access to anything, because when they came in, they said, hey, what to say?

I mean, can''t we have access to it?

The CEO was like, well, everything.

And they''re like, all right, guys, take everything.

This is a cloud-based company.

So when you take everything back then, we ran all the servers.

So they were about to take all of our servers, which would just bankrupt us instantly.

Fortunately, he convinced them something else that I was an intern or something weird, and they only took my stuff, just my computer, my phone.

And at that point, I got an attorney, and we ended up basically fighting with the LADA for about six months.

The Los Angeles DA charged Sammy with modifying data on a remote machine.

In settlement talks, prosecutors proposed that Sammy served some time in prison and not be able to use his computer for the rest of his life.

Keep in mind that Sammy was supporting his mother, and as a high school dropout, his only skill set in his livelihood We''re entirely dependent on using a computer.

Semi was so bright and gifted and passionate about computers and technology on the internet and hacking.

You can imagine how scary it was for him to face the prospect of having to live the rest of his life without ever being able to use a computer again.

Probably the hardest part, really the hardest part of anything I think, at least for me, is not knowing what an outcome will be.

I think it''s much easier to deal with, maybe even the most challenging outcome.

If I know that''s going to happen, you just tell me, okay, I''m going to go to the prison for the rest of my life, then I can at least mentally try to prepare for that.

But not knowing was just really difficult to deal with.

But ultimately, I took a plea agreement with them.

And the plea agreement was no prison time, so that was nice.

However, I would not be able to touch a computer for the rest of my life.

That was still in there.

And probation indefinitely, I would have to pay some restitution, I''d have to do a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

In fact, it also explicitly stated I could not access MySpace.com', '2024-10-31 05:24:14', '2024-10-31 05:24:14');

' a ton of community service.

Like picking up so much trash, I could really help make those streets cleaner.

But the silver lining was that if I was on a good behavior, if like my probation officer, you know, said I was a good person, after some of my reviewers I could get everything removed.

As long as I completed my community service, I''d be able to get rid of the probation and be the normal citizen again and be able to touch a computer in the internet.

And I said, okay, well that at least is a known quantity.

I don''t think I''m going to be writing anymore viruses.

I can do a couple of years of no computers, no internet, so I agreed to that and I was probably 20 at this point because this process was just such a long process and one day I just went to court and told something I could no longer touch computer or touch the internet.

In fact, it also explicitly stated I could not access MySpace.com, so in case I somehow was able to access it without the internet of our computer.

So that was it.

Sammy had lost everything.

I mean, forget about the Porsche at this point, because on top of all this, they gave him a $20,000 fine.

So between having to pay all the lawyers and the fine and still having to support his mom, yeah, he was almost completely wiped out, almost back to zero, living as cheap as possible.

But still, forget all that.

I don''t think Sammy carried about the money at this point.

He was back to trying to figure out what he should do with his entire life.

No internet for life?

Everything he''s been working towards, all his skills and knowledge are useless now.

Sammy had 720 hours of community service he had to complete.

So every Saturday morning, he''d get up at 5 a.m. and go clean trash on the side of the highway for years.

Even if he did six hours every Saturday, that''s still just 300 hours a year, so everything about Sammy''s life was changed.

And he had to find new things to do that didn''t involve a computer to keep himself busy.

But I was really fortunate.

I mean, I met new people, I spent all that time just sort of doing other things that I had never really spent time doing.

I went outside, I saw the sun was like, ah, it''s so bright, but I got used to it.

that I made friends, I turned 21, so I get started going out meeting people, started learning to socialize a lot more.

So it''s really, really beneficial to me and something I wouldn''t really change today learned so much from that experience.

And I think it was good for someone so introverted and so stuck to a computer to be able to go out and experience other things.

So Sammy spent years of his life offline, doing his community service and trying to socialize with his friends.

But the story doesn''t end here.

After the break, Sammy gets to use computers again.

This episode is sponsored by Grammarly.

It''s pretty daunting.

Starting the work day and seeing unread messages here, unread emails there, and some documents you''ve got to go over and edit.

10 minutes in and you''re already drowning in the tabs you have open.

I find the key to managing multiple tasks is to focus on finishing each task one by one.

After two years of probation, Sammy has served all 720 hours of his community service.

He had great behavior.

The probation officer didn''t find anything wrong that Sammy did.

And since he had such great behavior, they went back to court to see if he could get the probation lifted.

And after a few years, I went back to court, and today, you know, my probation officer loves me.

It says I''m our favorite client, and they said, okay, you are a lot of touch computers again.

That was a very interesting experience.

I felt really weird touching the computer afterwards.

We kind of just get used to the rules that you''re abiding by, and it''s definitely an awkward feeling jumping back in.

What happens on that day that you got it back?

I definitely remember that day because I drove to the LA Courthouse and after I left the courthouse, I drove to the office store and found whatever the latest, you know, top of the line.

I don''t even think it was a MacBook.

It might have been a power book at that time.

I bought the top of the line power book and I went to a coffee shop.

I pulled it open and I connected to the Wi-Fi and I visited a couple of websites, so I think I visited the flash drive just to see what''s going on.

And I just felt really weird and I just shut the laptop and I went to go hang out with friends.

This started the next chapter in Sammy''s life.

Now that he was free to use the computer again, he eventually got back into it, way into it.

Even though he hadn''t been allowed to use a computer for the last two years, he had spent that time thinking of all sorts of things he can do with them.

During that time that I had no internet, I had no computers.

I started thinking about new exploits, new ways to really manipulate more systems and like exploit routers and exploit firewalls and just had some concepts literally just in my head and I couldn''t confirm whether they were accurate or not, whether they would work after I came back online.

And I started thinking, well, this stuff is fun.

Like maybe I can do this stuff, but not impact websites, not impact people negatively.

So how can I investigate the technology around us, look for the vulnerabilities around us and then share that information publicly in an entirely legal way so people actually understand the problems and can use solutions.

So just six months after Sammy had completed his probation for hacking my space, as 2008, Sammy was around 21 years old and starts looking into hacking credit cards, specifically the NFC and RFID chips on them.

Yeah, some other researchers and myself, we''re looking at these NFC credit cards which are becoming a lot more ubiquitous today but back then it was fun kind of funny they actually came out with these credit cards with NFC and pretty quickly they were encrypted somewhere encrypted however you could actually just buy a chip with the decryption key so you would just buy a chip from a company and you could then decrypt anyone''s credit card access their credit card info and then literally steal stuff with it and that was not my intention But I want to show that this stuff is not secure, so I just created a proof of concept that opened up this to some additional credit cards And there were some other tools that did similar things for other types of credit cards And I know mine was like a visa chase card that no one hadn''t done this for yet How close to someone do you have to be to get their credit card details?

Like does it work from far away?

I haven''t really experimented with how far you can do it So I''m not sure you do need to be close to them It''s very easy to be within proximity of many many people you just go to a crowded place and now you can see all many, many credit cards and then you can go home and buy a ton of stuff online or you can sell those credit cards online and really just steal money.

Even just bumping up against someone in the line, if they have an NFC or RFID vulnerable credit card in their pocket, that would be good enough to steal their credit card, right?

That''s correct.

That''s such a trip.

You know what''s funny is after releasing that and demonstrating that NFC then disappeared from our credit cards and it only recently re-emerged in the past few years and now with much stronger cryptography and additional safeguards from these sorts of tax.

However, there are other attacks.

I mean, it will always be cat and mouse right now.

Nothing is ever perfectly secure and to be fair, it''s much easier to be the attacker.

Well, Sammy studied how to hack the chips within credit cards.

He never did anything malicious with this.

He never actually stole anyone''s credit cards that he didn''t have permission to steal.

Instead, he started blogging about this and teaching others about the safety involved with these products in an attempt to make them more secure.

And from then on, Sammy would continue to research the security of so many more things, but always in an ethical and safe way.

He would do this on his own equipment and disclose what he found to vendors.

For instance, Sammy recently released a proof of concept to show how you can steal passwords and encryption keys by just listening.

This sort of stuff has been done for years by other people, by researchers, and I''m just trying to see can I do this on a two dollar chip or an Arduino that many people know how to use and many makers can just buy off the shelf and then they perform these types of attacks.

There''s a tax out there where researchers have demonstrated just taking a phone, a regular phone, putting it near a computer, and when a computer is doing some sort of cryptographic operation and maybe it''s encrypting an email, maybe it''s trying to send some Bitcoin, maybe it''s doing a financial transaction, maybe it''s logging into a bank.

When any of these things are being done and the processor is like processing those instructions in a certain order, Well, the processor requires power and different instructions require different amounts of power.

So, addition will be less power than a multiplication, which is really just a bunch of additions.

And you can then measure that power, but if you have a phone, you can use the microphone.

So, let''s say I''ve put a phone next to someone''s laptop and they''re encrypting an email with like the secret key.

Well, when that CPU is pulling power from all these capacitors, those capacitors are going through this thing called electro-strictive effect and they''re physically moving inside your computer and they''re moving at a speed, a rate against the circuit board inside that produces ultrasound.

You and I can''t hear ultrasound, but the phones that we have, the mobile devices we have, those microphones actually can listen all the way into the ultrasound range.

And if you have, say, an Android device with a microphone enabled and it listens to that ultrasound, you can then look at that sound, that amplitude or the volume of the sound, And then correlated and say, well, the higher the sound, the more power those capacitors are using and feeding to the CPU.

And if I know it''s this much power for this long, well, I can do timing and power analysis and say, well, that means you''re doing an addition here or you''re probably doing a jump or a branch here or a comparison here.

And this looks like you''re doing an AES encryption at 128 bit key.

And, you know, if you''re encrypting with a zero bit or so one bit, that''s going to take different instructions with different amount of power.

and then I can fully recover that key.

It''s pretty impressive.

And these are the types of attacks that are really explaining physical phenomena, right?

Things that a software developer might implement something perfectly, but there''s still these other attacks.

Sammy continued finding new areas to do security research in.

And at some point, he got interested in cookies.

Cookies are what web browsers use to remember who you are.

So when you return to a website, they can log you in or show you content that''s just for you.

So cookies are a tracking mechanism, and browser store these cookies on the user''s computer.

In a very specific location, but as Sammy looked into it, he was noticing some websites figured out a way to track users without storing the cookie in that traditional location.

For instance, some sites ran Flash to display fancy graphics.

Well, when you get to that website, the Flash video is downloaded and stored on your computer, and the next time you go to that website, your browser checks to see if you already have that video or if you need to download it.

But people were really concerned because some researchers found that some companies were using flash to store cookies on people''s computers.

And the benefit of this was that if a user deletes their normal cookies, their normal web browser or cookies, which is what advertisers used to track you, well, then the flash cookie was essentially acting as a backup, right?

And really serotoniously, because they obviously did that intentionally because they knew users might delete their omics.

And I was thinking, well, the browser was a pretty powerful piece of software until a lot of things.

I wonder what other mechanisms where I could actually store information locally.

And again, this is sort of a proof of concept to demonstrate what are all the ways that we can store information on a person''s computer whether they know it or not.

So I created this open source JavaScript library called EverCookie and it used normal cookies.

So it essentially generated random ID to track somebody.

And then you store it in their normal cookies, you store it in flash cookies.

But then I tried to find every possible other mechanism that you could use locally.

So there were silver lights.

So you silver light storage and then Java and HTML5 came out.

So then there was local storage and session storage, global storage, SQL light, local cache, your web history.

My friend Matt came up with a really cool idea of just storing the data in an image that would get cached.

And then you could actually read out the pixels of an image and then converted it back to an ID, all sorts of stuff.

And that was people like Matt and other people also started contributing to this project as it''s an entirely open source project on GitHub that that anyone can actually contribute to.

This ever cookie project that Sammy made really demonstrated how easy it is for websites to track their users even if they delete their cookies.

And this was a really effective technique.

So effective that when Snowden released a bunch of classified documents about what the NSA is doing, in there it even said that the NSA sometimes uses ever cookie to track its users through tour.

A couple people pointed out to me over the years that different governments have been using ever cookie to try to track people.

And it definitely feels good that a lot of governments are using my software, granted they''re doing it for a reason that I''m not into.

But I actually think the net gain of the entire project is extremely positive because whatever cookie really provided and still provides today is an asset test.

So now browsers essentially can use ever cookie to see, okay, does my private mode, does my incognito mode, does that provide the necessary protection to make get challenging to track this user, at least using local storage mechanisms.

And before ever cookie, there was nothing like that.

So no one knew about many of these techniques, and it''s very trivial for any company or government to then generate their own techniques.

But by consolidating it into a very simple to use the library, and always trying to keep it up to date, you know, people today are still updating ever cookie with new techniques.

Modern browsers that want to provide consumers and users and businesses privacy, it gives in that capability, because they know, okay, I''ve tested it at least against Evercooki, which is sort of state of the art and local storage mechanisms, and Evercooki can''t track it, so at least it makes it very difficult.

So governments who are using it, they''re really only able to track all browser users who don''t upgrade their browsers to operating systems.

Where people who actually do care about their privacy, those people typically know to use modern up-to-date software.

So I think the overall net gain is extremely beneficial.

Let''s talk about Skyjack then, because I think this is a really cool project.

What is Skyjack?

Skyjack started when I started hearing that Amazon was potentially going to use drones to deliver packages.

And I thought that was really cool, I mean, I think it''s really awesome that we have drones.

I think drones are super interesting, they''re low cost, and they''ll probably enable a lot of really useful things for humans.

However, I was somewhat concerned that that was the idea.

was like delivering just packages because I don''t really know if there''s any security on drones.

So I wasn''t sure I really didn''t know anything about drones so I went out and I bought the most ubiquitous consumer drone and then soon after I also bought industrial drones, type of drones that police use.

And immediately I started looking to see what are the protection mechanisms at least in the consumer drone and immediately I found absolutely zero.

Literally none.

You know one drone was using essentially Wi-Fi to be controlled and you could hijack that connection.

You could only have one person controlling the drone at a time, so if I would just essentially kick that person off and then I would take over and then I would modify the drone software so that the person could never log back in and then I would have full control and I found that I could do that and then I started looking at more industrial drones and found that they did have encryption.

However, that encryption was not good at all.

Basically, if you sat on a radio frequency channel, essentially it''s doing frequency hopping, So the transmitter is jumping around to different frequencies for various reasons, partially security, partially to prevent jamming or if there''s a lot of interference that interference will disappear after it hops to the next frequency.

But that was also based off the encryption key.

I found a packet sit on a single frequency and I see two packets come in from that drone, essentially it would have hopped hundreds of times.

And then I jump onto another frequency and I see it hopped on that frequency two times.

all of that would typically take a couple seconds tops.

I would then be able to reverse the key within a second.

I would be able to understand what the encryption key is and then I would be able to hop along and take over that drone as well.

So at that point I put all of this into an open source project called Skyjack.

I put on GitHub and I took a Raspberry Pi Linux computer.

I put my software on it.

I added some Wi-Fi transceivers and some sub-gigaheads transceivers for the industrial drones and you would then attach this Raspberry Pi to your own drone, and you''d fly your own drone around, and while you''re flying your drone around, Skyjack ever saw another drone on any of these wireless frequencies or within wireless range, it would then hijack and take over that drone, and you would now be in control of both drones.

In fact, any wireless drones found in the vicinity, you would take over all of them, and you''d be controlling a swarm of zombie drones entirely under your control from one transmitter.

And that was sort of the proof of concept there, and it was a really fun project, especially fun to be testing it.

Of course, I was testing only on my own drones that I owned, but it of course affected pretty much all models of old major drones at time.

No, I''ve flown a drone.

And one of those scariest feelings I''ve ever had is when you lose control of the thing and it just starts doing its own thing for whatever reason, right?

I mean, that''s a little bit evil what you''re doing here.

I''m not taking over anyone''s else''s drone.

I''ve only taken over my own.

Okay.

But giving the world the ability to do it, I don''t know.

I would disagree with that statement because the world has always had that capability of doing it, right?

How do you know people other people aren''t doing it already?

I would actually suspect that there are plenty of organizations who are doing it.

They''re just not going to tell you about it, right?

They''re not going to put it on the internet.

They''re not going to put it on GitHub and let you know that they''re taking over people''s drones or that they''ve developed the software and hardware necessary to do it.

They''re just going to create that and they''re going to stockpile it so that they can use it against people or companies or governments at their will.

That''s what we found when the NSA say leaks came out, we found out that they were stockpiling all of these vulnerabilities, including major, major vulnerabilities that affected many even the NSA that wants to protect America, knows that everyone''s running, say Windows computer, many people are running Windows computers, and they stockpiled Windows vulnerability zero days that nobody knew about.

It was only when one of these databases from the NSA was bleak that criminals were then able to use those exploits and actually attack many, many millions of computers around the internet, Americans and non-Americans, I don''t think it matters where you''re from.

So what I''m doing by releasing this stuff is demonstrating that, yes, this is the issue and you can patch it.

If I don''t release it, then the issue will continue to exist.

You might ask, well, why don''t I just directly communicate with the companies?

Often I do.

And I found over time that when you communicate directly with companies, they typically don''t resolve these sorts of things.

Unless you''re talking maybe existing, you know, specific software vulnerabilities in their architecture.

But if you''re saying, hey, you''re not using encryption or using like really wrong or it''s really the underlying protocol that is the issue.

I found that that''s when people don''t actually resolve anything.

And that''s when I started releasing stuff publicly and finding, oh, if you release a cool proof of concept that demonstrates the real problem, the underlying core problem, even if it''s not necessarily an issue with maybe the manufacturer, but rather a problem with the underlying protocol and just assumptions that were made, there is enough public pressure that causes that company to then resolve that issue due to the public pressure, not due to the vulnerability itself.

Because that''s often what companies are trying to do and no fault to them.

They''re trying to do what their customers want, right?

They''re trying to do what might move the needle for them.

And I found that this is an effective and appropriate way I believe to move the needle in a direction that I believe will help many people overall rather than just manufacture a company or a specific organization.

Has any company gotten upset with you and tried to come after you for some reason of disclosing vulnerabilities in their system publicly?

I''ve gotten seasoned assists many times, and it''s extremely fortunate that the EFF electronic frontier foundation, they have actually been very helpful to me, and they''re a nonprofit of attorneys who are really just looking for consumers and digital rights.

So your ability to have free speech online, your ability to inspect the software and hardware you use, the ability to own the things that you purchase.

I mean, there are companies who are trying to take this away from us.

But the EFF, I mean, really fortunate where they''ve defended me in some of these regards.

And so I''ve never had to succumb to and actually agree to assist to this day.

For the last decade, Sammy has continued to take on very interesting projects, hacking into stuff and exposing vulnerabilities.

Like another thing he found was that smartphones were tracking their users without their knowledge, which was a revelation that led to a class action lawsuit.

This all started because I was looking at I think a beta version of Firefox at the time.

And I was looking at the release notes and it talked about geolocation and I said cool that''s interesting like I''ve always been interested in location like being able to locate where someone is whether it''s on their cell phone or their computer or laptop or whatever.

And you know there''s always been these geo IP databases that sort of give you geography but really they''re or maybe accurate to the city, but often not.

And even city accuracy is not that great.

So I saw this thing about HTML5 geolocation and a Firefox data, and I started investigating, I wrote some code according to API of how it worked.

I ran it and all of a sudden, my browsers showed me exactly where I was.

Like literally, it showed me the physical address of my home.

And I was like, that''s absolutely crazy.

I''m on a laptop and my laptop does not have GPS.

I know that for a fact.

So how does it know where I am?

And I started sniffing the packets to see where it was going.

I mean, granted, you could just look at the source code.

It''s Firefox, so it''s open source.

And after sniffing, and I think maybe intercepting the TLS, I saw that it''s taking all of the wireless MAC address, all of the unique MAC addresses, all the routers around you, NAPs, and sending that to Google.

So even if your wireless routers are encrypted, and even if you don''t have one, and there are other people who have them, even if they''re encrypted, the MAC address is a unique identifier that isn''t unencrypted.

and your computer sends all of those to Google.

And Google returns the exact location that you''re located.

And you''re also sending only the wireless routers but the signal strength of each of them.

So then they can actually perform what''s called trilaterations, like triangulation, but essentially they use that signal strength and then really accurate this term where you are.

And I''m like, this is absolutely crazy.

How are they figuring all this out?

And I found that you''re basically sending all of these unique Mac addresses of all these routers around you and Google would send back.

your exact location.

So then I''m wondering, well, how does Google know where all these routers are?

And I thought about it some and I thought about some more and then I was, oh, there''s these Google Street View cars and these Google Street View cars are driving around and they have cameras on them and that''s where you get Street View from, right?

That really helpful feature of Google Maps where you can see like a Street View.

And I realized that they must have computers and like Wi-Fi systems on there that are also monitoring for these Wi-Fi Mac addresses and then correlating it with the GPS of the Street View Car and then uploading it all to Google and that''s how they''re getting this information.

It''s like that''s really clever.

And I started doing talks about this because I then found a way that I could essentially abuse that API and use it for myself whenever someone visit my website and I could see exactly where they were and I could even show them.

You''d come to my website, without your authorization, I could then send your Mac address and find where you are.

And I was talking about this in broader Slava and Slovakia and afterward someone said, say I mean, it''s interesting, but fortunately, you know, this does not apply to us because Google Street View cars are not allowed here.

Interesting.

So I''ll just give it a shot and try to running it, just confirm.

And oddly enough, it still worked.

It actually worked very accurately.

And it''s like, wait a second.

I don''t think Google''s lying.

I don''t believe that they are doing something illegal.

I don''t think they have Street View cars when they say they''re not doing that.

And you would notice, I mean, those cars stick out with with these massive sensors on top of them.

So what else might Google have access to, especially in somewhere random like Bratislava?

And I thought a little bit more and then realized, oh wait, Android phones.

There are Android phones everywhere.

And I wonder if these Android phones are actually we''re driving machines.

And after the reverse engineering, some binary blobs on Android devices, this was not actually in the source code that I could find.

I found these binaries that were essentially grabbing all Wi-Fi Mac addresses, is sending the signal strength of all these wireless routers up to Google along with GPS coordinates.

So essentially every Android phone in existence is a war driving machine for Google.

That''s grabbing all this information, grabbing all this location data.

So even if you don''t use an Android phone, other Android phones near you are then taking your routers information and sending it up with the location.

Sammy also figured out that iPhones were doing the same thing, but sending the data to Apple instead of Google.

And what''s worse is that in some cases, this was happening even after users turned off the location services or GPS.

Well, this was encrypted, so it took a little time to really understand what was going on in reverse engineering stuff.

And to really just demonstrate this as a fun proof of concept, I created a tool, really just a simple mobile app that behaved just like Google Maps.

And I found that Google was actually doing something really clever with their information, not only were they collecting where everyone was at all times via Android devices, but that''s also how they collect traffic.

So that''s how you know whether a street is green, yellow, or red, and whether there''s traffic or not in Google Maps is because all of the phones are constantly delivering their GPS location.

And if you time that, if you say, all right, I''m here now and in 10 seconds I''m here, well, you can calculate the distance they traveled over that time and know how fast they''re moving.

So that''s how they get Google Maps traffic.

So Sam, he thought about this for a minute and realized if the Android phones are the ones that are delivering data to Google and giving the traffic updates for the Google Maps, could he somehow exploit that?

Could he somehow trick Google servers into thinking there''s a traffic jam when there''s really not?

I created a app that was just like Google Maps and you''d start from point A and say, I''m at this location and I want to drive to wherever to West Hollywood.

And it would give you turn-by-turn directions.

But on those turn-by-turn directions of my route, it would sound only tangibly pretend to be thousands and thousands of other Android devices.

And all those devices, all those fake devices, would send up information to Google saying, hey, I''m one of these Android devices, and I''m moving zero miles per hour.

So all of a sudden, my route, the route that my app gave me, would turn red and black for everyone else, and they would get diverted to different routes on Google Maps.

And hopefully, my route would be a little bit faster as there would be less cars on the road.

And that was sort of my proof and concept to demonstrating this sort of this issue.

And I''ve some of this could even continue even when you turned off these features, like, location.

I love this hack.

To make it so wherever you drive, Google traffic is diverting drivers to go away from you because it''s congested wherever you are.

Even though it''s not congested where you are, you''re just sending fake data to Google.

It''s just brilliant.

Yeah, you know, it''s the proof of concept just to poke fun at the information and kind of just demonstrate like what this information is capable of doing.

While this is cool, the underlying issue here is that users were unknowingly sending their exact location to Google.

And I don''t know about you, but I don''t personally like that Google knows exactly where my phone is at all times.

I just think it''s a violation of privacy of some sort.

And you know what?

I''m not the only one who thinks that.

Yeah, so ultimately, you know, the biggest issue was that people weren''t accepting that A, they were sending all this data up.

So ultimately, Google and Apple had to appear on Capitol Hill because they previously said, no, we''re not tracking you.

And, you know, this research demonstrated that, yes, in fact, they were tracking exactly where you are virtually at all times.

And in some cases, it begins to your consent when you turned off location services on Apple.

Again, those devices were still sending information that allowed full location of where you were because it was sending Mac addresses, which they already knew where those were.

So it''s simply one step correlation in a database they already have.

So that''s not really fair to say that they''re not grabbing that information.

And ultimately, you know, they did resolve these things.

You know, it''s funny that the same thing is still happening, right?

All these phones are still doing the same things.

The only difference is now you click OK when they say they do it.

But the benefit here is that for people who don''t want this sort of technology to run, they can say no on their phone.

The scary thing, though, is that even if you don''t even have one of these phones, it''s all the phones around that are still collecting that information of your router, of the devices on your network, even though it''s somebody else''s device.

I saw a video the other day about a guy who put like a hundred Android cell phones all in a wagon and slowly walked down the road, and this triggered the Google location API thing to make it show that the road was really congested and made it turn red as well.

So it looks like this API is still under attack just by researchers and people doing weird stunts and stuff So yeah, Sammy has a pretty cool YouTube channel.

You should check that out And he''s also given a lot of talks at various conferences like she''s all over the world How many talks have you given at this point Sammy?

I don''t know maybe 50 or so Where are you working now and after all days?

I mean this is just such a whirlwind life you''ve had so far I''ve started a company called Open Path with some friends, and we''ve been growing quite a bit.

I''ve done some research in RFID and cloning badges, and being able to demonstrate how to break into buildings.

Many years ago, we found that technology has not changed in the 10 years since I''ve looked.

You know, wrote software that was able to clone badges and break into various levels of security for physical access for buildings.

And we were sitting around and thinking, well, you know, why is this still a problem?

And it''s still inconvenient.

Like, why do I have to carry around this thick card in my wallet?

like I''m trying to get rid of my wallet.

And we ended up building this business called Open Path where you could essentially have physical access control for businesses and buildings where, hey, you don''t need a card.

You could use a card if you wanted, but you could just use your phone.

Your phone actually has really strong encryption.

We have things like TLS, we have AES, we have open encryption standards that people have been trying to break for many, many years and haven''t that are entirely open and can be inspected by anyone.

So we''re using those technologies to essentially unlock doors and you don''t even need to pull your phone out.

You literally just get within Bluetooth range of one of these devices, then you can walk right in as long as you have authorization.

So we''re trying to really make a really modern and cloud-based and secure way of getting into buildings that is just really convenient because I''m just trying to get rid of the things in my wallet and this kind of technology is just really interesting.

Yes, that technology is interesting, but so much technology is interesting.

And we live in a time where technology is in abundance all around us.

And if you think about technology as much as Sammy does, it''s like a playground for him.

To be able to tinker with it all and take it apart and put it back together in ways it was never intended, Sammy''s hacker mindset is still going strong today and it will probably be strong for decades more to come, provided he doesn''t accidentally launch another warm and take down the largest social networking website once again.

A big thank you to Sammy Camcart for coming on and telling us all this.
